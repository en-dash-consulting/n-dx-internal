## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **Top-level Token Usage Navigation**
  Expose Token Usage as a first-class dashboard destination at the same hierarchy level as Settings without breaking existing navigation contracts.
- **Remove zone grid display from SourceVision zones page**
  Remove the large grid of zones that currently displays under the graph on the SourceVision zones page to clean up the interface and prepare for slideout-based interaction
  - Zone grid component is removed from zones page layout
  - Page displays only the graph without grid below
  - No layout shifts or broken UI elements after removal
- **Add PR Markdown tab to SourceVision navigation and routing**
  Expose a first-class tab so users can find PR-ready output without leaving SourceVision or running separate commands.
  - Sidebar or section navigation includes a PR Markdown entry under SourceVision
  - Selecting the tab updates URL/hash routing consistently with existing patterns
  - Tab loads without breaking existing SourceVision views
  - Tab displays initial loading, success, and empty states
- **Expose override markers in CLI/status and machine-readable outputs**
  Ensure override decisions are visible to operators and automation so duplicate exceptions can be reviewed and governed.
  - Rex status/output surfaces an indicator for items created via force-create override
  - JSON outputs include override marker fields without breaking existing schema consumers
  - Output clearly differentiates override-created items from merged or normal additions
- **Implement canonical redirect rules from legacy Rex token URLs**
  Add or refine redirect normalization so old Rex-prefixed token usage URLs resolve to the global token usage route, preserving user bookmarks and shared links during the ownership migration.
  - Legacy Rex token usage URL variants redirect to the canonical global token usage URL
  - Redirect logic avoids loops and always terminates at a single canonical destination
  - Direct navigation to the canonical token usage URL renders without intermediate error states
- **Review sourcevision circular dependency findings for llm-client package**
  ## Findings

Sourcevision analysis (2026-02-24T05:11:49, git sha 536ec50) detected **4 circular dependency chains** in `packages/llm-client/src/`.

### Root Cycle

All 4 chains are sub-paths of a single root cycle:

```
provider-interface.ts → llm-types.ts → create-client.ts → api-provider.ts → provider-interface.ts
provider-interface.ts → llm-types.ts → create-client.ts → cli-provider.ts → provider-interface.ts
```

### Dependency Graph (pre-fix)

```
provider-interface.ts ──imports LLMVendor──→ llm-types.ts
       ↑                                          │
       │                              imports CreateClientOptions
       │                                          ↓
 api/cli-provider.ts ←──provides factory── create-client.ts
       │
       └──imports LLMProvider──→ provider-interface.ts
```

### The 4 Chains Reported

1. `api-provider.ts → provider-interface.ts → llm-types.ts → create-client.ts`
2. `api-provider.ts → provider-interface.ts → llm-types.ts → create-client.ts` (type import duplicate)
3. `provider-interface.ts → llm-types.ts → create-client.ts`
4. `cli-provider.ts → provider-interface.ts → llm-types.ts → create-client.ts`

### Affected Modules

- `provider-interface.ts` — LLMProvider interface + (was) LLMVendor consumer
- `llm-types.ts` — vendor-neutral types + (was) LLMVendor definition
- `create-client.ts` — Claude dual-provider factory
- `api-provider.ts` — Anthropic SDK provider
- `cli-provider.ts` — Claude CLI provider

### Root Cause

`provider-interface.ts` imported `LLMVendor` from `llm-types.ts`. `llm-types.ts` imported `CreateClientOptions` from `create-client.ts`. Both providers imported `LLMProvider` from `provider-interface.ts` to implement it. This formed a structural cycle even though all cross-layer imports were `import type`.

### Resolution (already applied in prior session)

`LLMVendor` was moved from `llm-types.ts` to `provider-interface.ts` as a self-contained definition. `llm-types.ts` re-exports it for backward compatibility. The `provider-interface.ts → llm-types.ts` import edge was eliminated, breaking all 4 chains. Zero circular dependencies remain.
  - All circular dependency cycles in llm-client are documented with affected modules
  - Dependency graph visualization shows current circular relationships
  - Root causes of each circular dependency are identified
- **Design dependency refactoring strategy for llm-client**
  ## Dependency Refactoring Strategy: llm-client Circular Dependency Resolution

### Problem Statement
Sourcevision identified 4 circular dependency chains in packages/llm-client, all rooted in one cycle:
  provider-interface.ts → llm-types.ts → create-client.ts → (api|cli)-provider.ts → provider-interface.ts

### Root Cause Analysis
The cycle formed through these steps:
1. provider-interface.ts imported LLMVendor from llm-types.ts
2. llm-types.ts imported CreateClientOptions (type) from create-client.ts
3. create-client.ts imported createApiClient/createCliClient from provider modules
4. Provider modules imported LLMProvider/ProviderInfo from provider-interface.ts

### Dependency Layer Hierarchy
The llm-client module has 7 distinct layers:
- Layer 0 (foundation): types.ts, exec.ts, output.ts, json.ts, help-format.ts, suggest.ts
- Layer 1 (interfaces): provider-interface.ts — generic LLMProvider contract
- Layer 2 (config): config.ts, llm-config.ts
- Layer 3 (providers): api-provider.ts, cli-provider.ts, codex-cli-provider.ts
- Layer 4 (factories): create-client.ts, llm-client.ts
- Layer 5 (management): provider-registry.ts, provider-session.ts
- Layer 6 (aggregation): llm-types.ts, public.ts

### Strategy: Type Relocation via Dependency Inversion
**Chosen approach**: Move LLMVendor from Layer 6 (llm-types.ts) to Layer 1 (provider-interface.ts), then re-export from llm-types.ts for backward compatibility.

**Rationale**:
- LLMVendor identifies which vendor a provider implements — it belongs with the provider interface contract
- provider-interface.ts is the lowest layer that uses the type (ProviderInfo.vendor: LLMVendor)
- Re-exporting from llm-types.ts ensures zero breaking changes for existing consumers

**Alternatives considered and rejected**:
1. Extract to vendors.ts (new file): Adds a new file for a two-value type union; hard to discover
2. Move CreateClientOptions to llm-types.ts: Makes llm-types.ts import from factories (wrong direction)
3. Use import type everywhere: Already applied but does not break structural/tool-detected cycles
4. Split provider-interface.ts: Over-engineering; the file is small and cohesive

### Modules Changed
- provider-interface.ts: +8 lines — define and export LLMVendor with explanatory comment
- llm-types.ts: +2 lines — import LLMVendor from provider-interface.ts and re-export it

### Backward Compatibility
- All consumers of LLMVendor from @n-dx/llm-client continue to work unchanged
- public.ts exports unchanged
- No changes required in dependent packages (hench, rex, sourcevision, web, claude-client)

### Verification
- 323/323 tests pass in @n-dx/llm-client after the fix
- Runtime import graph: no circular dependencies remain
- Type-only imports (import type) form no runtime cycles and are safe
- Sourcevision circular dependency chain count: 4 → 0
  - Refactoring plan specifies which modules to split or merge
  - Strategy identifies shared abstractions to extract
  - Plan maintains backward compatibility for public API
  - Approach minimizes impact on dependent packages
- **Update package exports to maintain public API compatibility**
  Ensure that public API exports remain consistent after internal restructuring, updating index files and package.json exports as needed
  - All public exports remain available at same paths
  - Package.json exports configuration is updated correctly
  - No breaking changes to external consumers
  - Internal reorganization is transparent to users
- **Implement remove task function in rex core**
  Create core function to safely remove individual tasks from the PRD structure while preserving parent-child relationships
  - Function removes task from parent feature/epic
  - Updates parent completion status if needed
  - Handles task dependencies and blocked relationships
  - Validates task exists before attempting removal
- **Implement branch work record JSON schema and storage**
  Define a JSON schema for tracking branch-specific work completion and implement file-based storage within the sourcevision package directory structure
  - JSON schema includes epic/feature/task hierarchy with completion timestamps
  - Schema supports metadata fields for change significance and breaking change flags
  - File is stored within .sourcevision/ directory with branch-specific naming
  - Schema validation prevents malformed records
- **Implement change significance classification**
  Add logic to classify completed work items by significance level (major changes, breaking changes, important functions) based on rex metadata and task descriptions
  - Breaking change detection from rex task tags and descriptions
  - Major change identification based on epic scope and task count
  - Important function classification from task acceptance criteria
  - Classification results persisted in branch work record
- **Remove manual PR markdown refresh mechanism**
  Remove the manual refresh button and endpoint from the SourceVision UI, making PR markdown generation fully automatic through the analyze flow
  - Manual refresh button removed from SourceVision PR markdown tab
  - Refresh endpoint removed from web server routes
  - UI displays clear messaging about automatic generation via analyze
  - Existing cached PR markdown remains accessible until next analyze run
- **Implement rex-based PR markdown template**
  Create a new PR markdown template that generates content from branch work record data, emphasizing completed epics, features, and significant changes
  - Template generates clean epic/feature completion list
  - Markdown highlights breaking changes with clear indicators
  - Template includes major change summary section
  - Important functions and features are prominently featured
- **Implement significance-based content prioritization**
  Structure generated PR markdown to prioritize content by significance level, featuring breaking changes and major updates prominently
  - Breaking changes appear in dedicated high-visibility section
  - Major features listed before minor tasks
  - Important function changes highlighted with code context
  - Content organization follows reviewer-friendly priority order
- **Add subCrossings field to Zone schema**
  Add optional subCrossings?: ZoneCrossing[] to Zone interface in packages/sourcevision/src/schema/v1.ts.
  - Zone interface has optional subCrossings?: ZoneCrossing[]
  - Field populated during subdivision
  - Existing consumers unaffected (non-breaking)

## Major Changes

- **Decompose PRDView god function into focused hooks** [critical]
  Extract PRDView (941 lines, 83 unique function calls) into focused custom hooks: usePRDData (fetch/polling/dedup), usePRDWebSocket (WS pipeline), usePRDActions (CRUD mutations), usePRDDeepLink (deep link resolution), useToast (notification state). PRDView should become a thin render shell that composes these hooks.
- **Address pattern issues (9 findings)** [critical]
  - Client-server architectural boundary is well-maintained except for schema-infrastructure zone violation
- Cross-cutting performance concerns are integrated into functional zones rather than separated into performance layers
- Domain boundary success varies dramatically: hench achieves clean layered isolation while web shows architectural sprawl across 29 zones
- Foundation anti-pattern where ui-foundation contains both infrastructure utilities and application-specific views
- Inconsistent service abstraction patterns across utility zones - some achieve clean boundaries while others leak implementation details to consumers
- Inconsistent use of abstraction patterns (hooks vs direct coupling) across similar UI zones indicates need for architectural standardization
- Zone size distribution shows healthy specialization pattern broken by one oversized catch-all zone that needs decomposition
- Critical architectural debt concentration in web package: 29 fragmented zones + god-zone pattern + systematic high coupling (12+ zones >0.6) indicates architectural reset needed before incremental improvements
- Missing abstraction layer pattern spans visualization (charts + navigation), UI foundation (scattered across zones), and service interfaces (inconsistent contract patterns), indicating systematic under-architecture rather than over-engineering
- **Extract viewer infrastructure into organized subdirectories** [critical]
  Move 19 root-level infrastructure files from viewer/ into logical subdirectories: viewer/performance/ (DOM optimization, memory, crash, degradation, gates), viewer/polling/ (state, manager, restart, visibility, tick, refresh), viewer/messaging/ (coalescer, throttle, rate limiter, dedup). Update all import paths. Add barrel exports. Addresses findings: cross-cutting performance concerns, oversized catch-all zone, god-zone pattern, missing abstraction layers.
- **Address suggestion issues (11 findings)** [critical]
  - Audit test-implementation pairs to identify orphaned tests and incomplete features that may indicate architectural boundary violations
- Consolidate scattered token usage functionality from polling-infrastructure and navigation-state-management into dedicated usage analytics zone
- Contract definition inconsistency across service zones - only command-validation uses explicit contracts.ts pattern
- Define architectural risk thresholds: zones with cohesion < 0.4 AND coupling > 0.6 should trigger mandatory refactoring
- Implement architectural risk scoring to identify zones with both low cohesion (<0.3) and high coupling (>0.7) for priority refactoring
- Prioritize refactoring zones with combined architectural risks: cohesion < 0.5 AND coupling > 0.6 indicate fragile components
- Three zones show catastrophic fragility (coupling >0.65, cohesion <0.4) requiring immediate architectural intervention before further development
- Decompose packages/web/src/viewer/views/prd.ts PRDView function (83 calls) into focused components: extract data fetching layer (estimated 20-25 calls), state management layer (estimated 15-20 calls), and presentation components (remaining calls)
- Establish architectural governance thresholds: zones with cohesion <0.4 AND coupling >0.6 require mandatory refactoring before new feature development - currently affects web-8, web-10, web-12, web-16 requiring immediate intervention
- Implement three-phase web package consolidation: Phase 1 - merge zones web-2,web-10,web-11,web-13 (shared coupling patterns), Phase 2 - consolidate visualization zones web-14,web-16,web-17,web-24, Phase 3 - extract shared UI foundation from primary web zone
- Refactor web-16 zone to reduce 13+ imports from web zone by extracting shared interface layer or moving components to appropriate architectural tier
- **Implement architectural risk scoring module in sourcevision** [critical]
  Consolidates 5 overlapping suggestions about architectural risk thresholds into a single risk scoring module. Add risk metrics to zones, classify zones into risk levels, and generate structured findings. Standardize on cohesion < 0.4 AND coupling > 0.6 as the governance threshold.
- **Preserve legacy deep links by routing old Token Usage URLs to the new top-level destination** [critical]
  Existing bookmarks and shared links must continue working so teams do not lose access patterns after the navigation restructure.
- **Codex Vendor Reliability and Documentation**
- **Implement normalized Codex response extraction in Hench run parser** [critical]
  Add a dedicated normalization layer that converts Codex-mode responses (including tool calls, partial text blocks, and completion markers) into the internal run event format used by Hench.
- **Map Codex usage payloads to unified token metrics** [critical]
  Implement explicit field mapping from Codex response usage data into the shared token accounting model used by Hench and Rex reports.
- **Selective Recommendation Acceptance Syntax**
- **Implement equals-prefixed index selector parsing for `recommend --accept`** [critical]
  Add command parsing support for values like `=1,4,5` so users can target specific recommendation indices without changing existing all-accept behavior.
- **Apply indexed selection to recommendation acceptance workflow** [critical]
  Wire parsed indices into the acceptance pipeline so only selected recommended items are accepted and persisted, preserving original recommendation ordering.
- **Init-time LLM Onboarding and Authentication**
- **Present interactive LLM provider selection screen** [critical]
  Add a user-friendly selection prompt during init that allows choosing `codex` or `claude` as the active provider.
- **Implement provider-specific auth status checks** [critical]
  Run a provider-specific preflight command after selection to determine whether the current shell session is authorized for the selected LLM.
- **Prompt provider-specific login command on auth failure** [critical]
  When preflight fails, show clear remediation with the exact login command for the chosen provider so users can complete setup immediately.
- **Live PR Markdown in SourceVision UI**
- **Implement PR markdown generator for current branch vs main** [critical]
  Create a generator that builds a structured markdown summary from git diff output so users can paste directly into pull requests without manual rewriting.
- **Implement auto-refresh triggers for file and git diff changes** [critical]
  Update the tab content automatically when the working tree or diff baseline changes so users always see current PR text without manual refresh.
- **SourceVision PR Markdown Tab Parity Hardening**
- **Register PR Markdown in the shared SourceVision tab configuration** [critical]
  Centralize PR Markdown in the same tab metadata structure used by Import Graph and Zones so sidebar rendering and view wiring are driven by one source of truth.
- **Normalize PR Markdown hash route parsing and tab selection state** [critical]
  Align PR Markdown route/hash handling with existing SourceVision views to prevent mismatches between URL, selected tab, and rendered content.
- **Integrate PR Markdown view with data and state endpoints under a unified refresh loop** [critical]
  Use `/api/sv/pr-markdown` for content and `/api/sv/pr-markdown/state` for availability, with coordinated refresh behavior so UI state and markdown output stay in sync.
- **Render cause-specific empty and error states with remediation guidance** [critical]
  Provide explicit messages and fix steps for known unavailability causes so users can self-resolve setup issues quickly.
- **SourceVision PR Markdown Quality & Manual Refresh**
- **Redesign PR markdown template around scope, notable changes, and shoutouts** [critical]
  Establish a new output structure that leads with concise scope-of-work and key highlights so reviewers can understand intent quickly.
- **Remove exhaustive per-file change tables from generated markdown** [critical]
  Reduce cognitive load by deleting detailed per-file tabular output and replacing it with concise grouped summaries.
- **Add SourceVision CLI command to refresh PR markdown on demand** [critical]
  Provide an explicit command entry point so users can regenerate PR markdown only when they choose.
- **Persist generated PR markdown and refresh metadata as cached artifact** [critical]
  Store generated content and metadata (including refresh timestamp and error state) so the UI can display stable results without recomputing.
- **Remove automatic PR markdown refresh triggers from file and git change watchers** [critical]
  Eliminate background regeneration to make freshness explicit and predictable for users.
- **Rex Token Usage & LLM Utilization UX Overhaul**
- **Implement unified usage event normalization across Rex, Hench, and SourceVision logs** [critical]
  Create a shared normalization path that converts vendor-specific usage payloads into one canonical shape so downstream aggregation is consistent.
- **Fix Rex token aggregation queries that return zero for tasks and dashboard totals** [critical]
  Correct the aggregation logic and joins/lookups so token totals resolve from normalized usage events to task-level and project-level views.
- **Repair task token tag binding to accumulated usage totals** [critical]
  Fix task metadata mapping so each task reflects real summed usage from associated runs rather than stale or defaulted values.
- **ndx Dashboard Refresh Orchestration**
- **Add `ndx refresh` command to CLI orchestration entrypoint** [critical]
  Expose a dedicated refresh command in the top-level CLI so dashboard refresh workflows are accessible without package-specific commands, reducing operator friction and script complexity.
- **Implement refresh plan builder for flag combinations and conflicts** [critical]
  Translate flag combinations into explicit step plans so each invocation has predictable behavior and invalid combinations are rejected before work starts.
- **Implement SourceVision-derived dashboard artifact refresh step** [critical]
  Add orchestration logic that refreshes generated dashboard artifacts used by the web UI so analysis-derived views stay synchronized with repository state.
- **Token Event Attribution Accuracy**
- **Persist vendor/model on Rex token usage events** [critical]
  Update Rex usage event emission to attach vendor and model from the active request context so each event is self-describing and survives config changes.
- **Persist vendor/model on Hench token usage events** [critical]
  Capture vendor/model at the moment Hench records run and task token usage so mixed-provider runs are attributed correctly per event.
- **Refactor utilization aggregation to group by event vendor/model** [critical]
  Change aggregation queries and reducers to use vendor/model stored on each event as the grouping key so historical and mixed-model usage is reported correctly.
- **Deterministic Task Utilization Budget Fallback**
- **Implement deterministic weekly budget resolver for vendor/model scopes** [critical]
  Create a single resolver that selects the weekly budget in a fixed order to eliminate ambiguous behavior when model-specific configuration is missing.
- **Wire deterministic budget resolver into task chip and detail utilization calculations** [critical]
  Route all task-level utilization percentage computation through the shared resolver so chips and detail panels cannot diverge.
- **Duplicate-aware Proposal Override for rex add**
- **Implement proposal-to-PRD duplicate matching across open and completed items** [critical]
  Prevent accidental duplicate creation by comparing generated proposal nodes against current PRD hierarchy, including completed epics/features/tasks that should still be considered duplicates.
- **Persist override marker metadata on force-created PRD items** [critical]
  Create an auditable record that a duplicate guard was overridden, including enough metadata to trace when and why the override happened.
- **Dashboard Route Ownership Decoupling**
- **Remove token-usage from Rex view scope registry** [critical]
  Prevent Rex-scoped route resolution from claiming Token Usage by deleting the token-usage entry from `VIEWS_BY_SCOPE.rex`. This eliminates conflicting ownership and ensures the route is resolved by global navigation config only.
- **Add regression tests for direct global reachability and legacy redirects** [critical]
  Create automated routing tests to prove Token Usage is directly reachable as a global destination and that legacy Rex links remain compatible through redirects.
- **PR Markdown Reviewer Context Enrichment**
- **Implement branch-to-PRD work item resolver** [critical]
  Create a resolver that maps branch changes to completed or in-progress PRD tasks and derives their parent epic titles, so PR summaries can show intent-level context instead of only code-level changes.
- **Implement significant-function and feature highlight extraction** [critical]
  Add logic to identify newly added or materially changed high-impact functions and user-visible features, enabling summaries that focus on reviewer-relevant changes.
- **SourceVision PR Markdown Refresh Degraded-Mode Hardening**
- **Implement degraded refresh response contract with cache retention** [critical]
  Ensure refresh returns a non-500 structured payload when generation fails for known git/base-branch conditions and cached markdown exists, so users keep usable output instead of losing access.
- **Add refresh failure classifier for git and base-branch resolution errors** [critical]
  Classify refresh failures into explicit diagnostic codes so clients can provide precise remediation guidance and avoid generic server-error messaging.
- **SourceVision PR Markdown Git Preflight and Credential Diagnostics**
- **Implement repository state preflight before PR markdown refresh** [critical]
  Add a preflight step that verifies the working directory is a git repository and the current HEAD is attached to a branch before any diff or fetch operation runs.
- **Add remote reachability and credential preflight checks** [critical]
  Proactively test remote connectivity and authentication so fetch-related issues are classified before refresh attempts fail with generic git errors.
- **SourceVision Semantic Diff Failure UX Hardening**
- **Guard cached PR markdown from semantic diff-stage invalidation** [critical]
  Prevent refresh from overwriting or clearing the last successful PR markdown artifact when failure occurs specifically during semantic diff inspection, preserving reviewer continuity.
- **Enforce deterministic non-interactive flags for semantic diff git invocations** [critical]
  Prevent local external diff drivers, textconv filters, or interactive paging from changing semantic diff behavior so refresh results stay consistent across environments.
- **Split semantic diff and name-status diff execution into independently classified stages** [critical]
  Ensure a semantic diff failure does not get conflated with name-status collection so diagnostics and fallback decisions are accurate.
- **SourceVision PR Markdown Artifact-Based Fallback Mode**
- **Implement git-failure fallback routing in PR markdown refresh pipeline** [critical]
  Route refresh execution to a fallback generator whenever preflight, fetch, or diff stages fail so the endpoint returns usable PR content instead of only an error state.
- **Add unit tests for fallback trigger classification across git failure modes** [critical]
  Protect routing logic by verifying that only intended preflight/fetch/diff failures activate fallback generation.
- **Git Credential Helper Opt-In Recovery**
- **Classify git auth failures and attach opt-in remediation hints** [critical]
  When refresh fails due to credential or auth issues, return a specific failure classification with a clear suggestion to run the new helper command instead of generic git errors.
- **Enforce non-interactive default behavior in refresh path** [critical]
  Ensure refresh never opens interactive credential flows unless explicitly requested, preventing hangs in CI and preserving existing automation behavior.
- **Git-Independent PR Markdown Generation**
- **Implement branch-scoped Rex work item collector** [critical]
  Build a collector that selects epics, features, and tasks relevant to the current branch from Rex state so PR summaries are grounded in planned and completed work, not git remote reachability.
- **Implement branch-scoped Hench run evidence collector** [critical]
  Add a run evidence layer that gathers executed-task context from Hench runs tied to the active branch so generated PR markdown reflects actual execution history.
- **Replace git-remote dependency in PR markdown refresh flow** [critical]
  Refactor the refresh pipeline to use the Rex/Hench branch evidence collectors as the primary and required data source, eliminating dependency on external git repository connectivity.
- **PR Markdown View Toggle and Copy UX**
- **Process Lifecycle Management and Graceful Shutdown**
- **Implement unified signal handler with cascading cleanup** [critical]
  Implemented unified signal handler with cascading cleanup (commit cb60d1c). Changes: (1) packages/web/src/server/start.ts: extracted registerShutdownHandlers() as an exported testable function with 30s overall timeout (configurable via N_DX_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS env var), double-signal handling (second SIGINT/SIGTERM forces immediate exit(1) while graceful shutdown is still running), signal name in logs, and injectable exit dep for testing. The function runs cleanup in dependency order: hench child processes first then WebSocket connections then HTTP server then port file. (2) packages/web/tests/unit/server/shutdown-handler.test.ts: 13 new unit tests covering signal handler registration, cleanup ordering, SIGINT/SIGTERM name logging, double-signal force-exit, timeout force-exit, timeout error message, port file removal, and completion log.
- **Add process tree cleanup with force termination fallback** [critical]
  Implement comprehensive child process cleanup that gracefully terminates processes with force-kill fallback for unresponsive processes
- **Implement port cleanup and resource release procedures** [critical]
  Add explicit port unbinding and resource cleanup procedures that execute during graceful shutdown to prevent port conflicts
- **LLM Client Circular Dependency Resolution**
- **Validate circular dependency resolution with sourcevision re-analysis** [critical]
  Run sourcevision analysis again on the refactored llm-client package to confirm all circular dependencies have been eliminated and no new issues were introduced
- **Execute comprehensive test suite to ensure functionality preservation** [critical]
  Test results: llm-client 323/323 tests pass. claude-client 211/211 tests pass. hench 912/912 tests pass (after fixing stale help text assertion). rex 2291/2300 tests pass (after fixing modify-reason.test.ts mock to use createLLMClient/detectLLMAuthMode). Pre-existing failures noted: feature-filtered-task.test.ts (9 failures for unimplemented featureId filter, commit 90442f0 Feb 13 2026) and sourcevision cli-serve.test.ts (1 e2e timeout, environment limitation). Commit: 3a5556b
- **Rex Task and Epic Deletion Functionality**
- **Implement remove epic function in rex core** [critical]
  Create core function to safely remove an epic from the PRD structure, handling child tasks and maintaining data integrity
- **PR Build Pipeline and Code Quality Automation**
- **Web UI Memory Management and Crash Resolution**
- **Profile memory usage patterns during web UI load and refresh cycles** [critical]
  Use browser dev tools and memory profiling to identify memory allocation patterns, leaks, and peak usage during initial load and subsequent refresh operations
- **Analyze refresh task orchestration for memory-intensive operations** [critical]
  Examine the ndx refresh command and related web UI refresh behaviors to identify operations that may be loading excessive data into memory
- **Fix memory leaks in refresh orchestration and component lifecycle** [critical]
  Identify and resolve memory leaks in React components, event listeners, timers, and refresh orchestration that prevent proper garbage collection
- **Branch Work System of Record**
- **Automatic PR Markdown Generation**
- **Enhanced Rex Recommend Selective PRD Creation**
- **Implement selective PRD creation from selected recommendations** [critical]
  Create PRD items from the selected recommendations using the existing rex add pipeline, replacing the acknowledge-only behavior
- **Memory-Aware Polling Loop Management**
- **WebSocket Message Performance Optimization**
- **TreeNodes DOM Performance Optimization**
- **Implement virtual scrolling container for TreeNodes component** [critical]
  Replace full tree rendering with a virtual scrolling container that only renders items within the viewport plus a configurable buffer zone
- **Timer Performance Optimization and Re-render Reduction**
- **Token Usage Aggregation Performance Optimization**
- **Background Tab Resource Optimization**
- **Hench Process Concurrency Management**
- **Hench Resource Monitoring and User Feedback**
- **File Format Enhancement for Requirements Import**
- **Recursive zone architecture**
  Make subdivision use the same full pipeline as root analysis. Same algorithm at every zoom level — fractal zones. Zone detection currently lumps components, routes, utils, and configs into mega-zones because subdivideZone() runs a stripped-down Louvain without resolution escalation, proximity edges, or splitLargeCommunities.
- **Extract runZonePipeline from analyzeZones** [critical]
  Extract the shared Louvain pipeline steps (buildUndirectedGraph, proximity edges, louvainPhase1, mergeBidirectionalCoupling, mergeSmallCommunities, capZoneCount, splitLargeCommunities, mergeSameIdCommunities, buildZonesFromCommunities, recursive subdivideZone, buildCrossings, assignByProximity) into a reusable runZonePipeline function in packages/sourcevision/src/analyzers/zones.ts. Accepts ZonePipelineOptions {edges, inventory, imports, scopeFiles, maxZones?, maxZonePercent?, parentId?, depth?, testFiles?} and returns ZonePipelineResult {zones, crossings, unzoned}.
- **Rewrite subdivideZone to use full pipeline** [critical]
  Replace the stripped-down Louvain in subdivideZone with a runZonePipeline call. Filter imports.edges to zone's internal edges, pass zone.files as scopeFiles, maxZones: 8, parentId: zone.id, depth: depth + 1. Prefix sub-zone IDs with zone.id/. Compute sub-crossings and store on zone.subCrossings. Thread testFiles through to subdivision.
- **LoE-Calibrated Proposal Generation in rex add**
- **Rex UI Consistency and Polish**
- **Audit all Rex page controls for broken interactivity and fix unresponsive elements** [critical]
  Systematically test every clickable and input element across Rex views. Non-functional controls erode user trust and make it unclear whether actions succeeded. Produce a fix list covering buttons that fire no handler, dropdowns that do not open, and status toggles that show no loading or confirmation state.

### Codex Vendor Reliability and Documentation

**Codex Token Accounting Accuracy**
- 🔶 **Map Codex usage payloads to unified token metrics**
  Implement explicit field mapping from Codex response usage data into the shared token accounting model used by Hench and Rex reports.
  - Input, output, and total token counts are populated from Codex usage data when available
  - When usage is absent, accounting records zero values plus a non-fatal diagnostic flag
  - Token mapping logic is isolated in a reusable function with unit tests
- Validate Codex token totals in run summaries and budget checks
  Wire mapped token metrics into run persistence and budget logic so Codex-mode runs affect totals identically to existing vendors.
  - Run summary output includes Codex-derived token totals
  - Budget threshold warnings trigger correctly for Codex-mode runs
  - Integration test confirms cumulative token totals increase after a Codex-mode execution

**Hench Codex Output Parsing Hardening**
- 🔶 **Implement normalized Codex response extraction in Hench run parser**
  Add a dedicated normalization layer that converts Codex-mode responses (including tool calls, partial text blocks, and completion markers) into the internal run event format used by Hench.
  - Parser accepts Codex responses with mixed text and tool-use blocks without throwing
  - Normalized output always includes status, assistant message text, and tool event metadata when present
  - Unknown block types are safely ignored with a warning instead of failing the run
- Add regression tests for malformed and partial Codex outputs
  Prevent future breakage by codifying edge cases seen in Codex mode, including truncated payloads and missing optional fields, so parser behavior is stable across vendor updates.
  - Test suite includes fixtures for truncated responses, empty content arrays, and missing usage fields
  - All malformed fixtures produce deterministic fallback behavior with no uncaught exceptions
  - CI passes with new parser tests enabled in the Hench test target

  Clarify how Rex and Hench behave across vendors, with explicit notes for Codex mode, to reduce operator confusion and support issues.

### Dashboard Route Ownership Decoupling

**Globalize Token Usage Route Ownership**
- 🔶 **Remove token-usage from Rex view scope registry**
  Prevent Rex-scoped route resolution from claiming Token Usage by deleting the token-usage entry from `VIEWS_BY_SCOPE.rex`. This eliminates conflicting ownership and ensures the route is resolved by global navigation config only.
  - `VIEWS_BY_SCOPE.rex` no longer contains a `token-usage` entry
  - Route resolution for `token-usage` does not depend on Rex scope helpers
  - Existing Rex-only views still resolve without regression after the removal
- Re-map token-usage in route state and UI metadata as global
  Update route-state, breadcrumb, and product-label mapping tables so Token Usage is classified as global/cross-cutting rather than Rex-owned, preventing incorrect section highlights and labels.
  - Route-state mapping classifies `token-usage` under global scope
  - Breadcrumbs for `token-usage` render without Rex section ancestry
  - Product/section labels for `token-usage` show global ownership consistently in header and nav

**Legacy URL Compatibility and Routing Regression Coverage**
- ⚠️ **Implement canonical redirect rules from legacy Rex token URLs**
  Add or refine redirect normalization so old Rex-prefixed token usage URLs resolve to the global token usage route, preserving user bookmarks and shared links during the ownership migration.
  - Legacy Rex token usage URL variants redirect to the canonical global token usage URL
  - Redirect logic avoids loops and always terminates at a single canonical destination
  - Direct navigation to the canonical token usage URL renders without intermediate error states
- 🔶 **Add regression tests for direct global reachability and legacy redirects**
  Create automated routing tests to prove Token Usage is directly reachable as a global destination and that legacy Rex links remain compatible through redirects.
  - Test covers direct navigation to canonical `token-usage` route and validates successful render
  - Test covers at least one legacy Rex token URL and asserts redirect target equals canonical global route
  - Test suite fails if token-usage is reintroduced under Rex scope mappings

- Globalize Token Usage Route Ownership *(feature)*
  Make Token Usage a first-class global dashboard destination instead of a Rex-scoped view so routing and UI metadata remain consistent across sections.
- Legacy URL Compatibility and Routing Regression Coverage *(feature)*
  Keep old Rex Token Usage links functional while enforcing the new global canonical route through deterministic redirects and tests.

### Deterministic Task Utilization Budget Fallback

**Task-Level Utilization Chips and Details Fallback UX**
- 🔶 **Wire deterministic budget resolver into task chip and detail utilization calculations**
  Route all task-level utilization percentage computation through the shared resolver so chips and detail panels cannot diverge.
  - Task chips and task detail views use the same resolver output for budget selection
  - When budget is resolved, utilization displays as a percentage rounded consistently across views
  - When budget is missing, both views render the same fallback label and reason state
  - No direct ad-hoc budget lookup remains in task-level UI calculation paths
- Add integration tests for missing-budget and partial-budget task utilization states
  Prevent regressions by verifying deterministic behavior for configured, partially configured, and unconfigured budget scenarios at task level.
  - Integration tests cover: exact vendor/model budget, vendor-only fallback, and no-budget fallback
  - Each scenario asserts chip text, detail text, and reason-code consistency
  - Tests verify identical utilization output for the same task across list and detail views
  - CI fails if fallback presentation or reason mapping changes unexpectedly

**Vendor/Model Budget Resolution Rules**
- 🔶 **Implement deterministic weekly budget resolver for vendor/model scopes**
  Create a single resolver that selects the weekly budget in a fixed order to eliminate ambiguous behavior when model-specific configuration is missing.
  - Resolver checks budget sources in documented order: vendor+model, vendor default, global default, then explicit no-budget
  - Given matching vendor+model budget, resolver returns that value and source `vendor_model`
  - Given missing model budget but present vendor default, resolver returns vendor default and source `vendor_default`
  - Given no configured budget at any level, resolver returns a no-budget sentinel and source `missing_budget`
- Validate weekly budget configuration and emit stable fallback diagnostics
  Harden config loading so invalid or partial budget data cannot produce inconsistent utilization calculations across runs.
  - Invalid budget entries (non-numeric, negative, NaN) are rejected with actionable validation errors
  - Config parsing normalizes vendor/model keys consistently before lookup
  - When lookup falls back or returns missing-budget, a machine-readable reason code is emitted for downstream UI use
  - Unit tests cover valid, partial, and invalid budget configurations

- Vendor/Model Budget Resolution Rules *(feature)*
  Define a deterministic resolution path for weekly token budgets so task-level utilization always computes from a known source or a consistent fallback state.
- Task-Level Utilization Chips and Details Fallback UX *(feature)*
  Ensure task-level utilization displays remain deterministic and understandable when weekly budgets are missing or only partially configured.

### Duplicate-aware Proposal Override for rex add

**Documentation and Test Coverage for Duplicate Overrides**
- Update CLI help and docs for duplicate detection and override choices
  Reduce operator confusion by documenting when duplicate prompts appear, what each option does, and how audit markers are represented.
  - CLI help for rex add documents duplicate-aware prompt behavior and all three actions
  - User-facing docs include examples for Cancel, Merge, and Proceed anyway flows
  - Docs describe persisted override marker semantics and where they appear
- Add unit and integration tests for duplicate detection, prompt outcomes, and override persistence
  Protect against regressions by testing detection accuracy and each user decision path end-to-end through persisted PRD state.
  - Unit tests cover duplicate matcher behavior for existing and completed-item matches
  - Integration tests verify Cancel writes nothing, Merge updates existing, and Proceed anyway creates marked items
  - Tests assert override marker presence only on force-created items and absence on merged/normal items

**Duplicate Detection and Reason Classification**
- 🔶 **Implement proposal-to-PRD duplicate matching across open and completed items**
  Prevent accidental duplicate creation by comparing generated proposal nodes against current PRD hierarchy, including completed epics/features/tasks that should still be considered duplicates.
  - Given a proposal with title/content matching an existing open item, the matcher returns a duplicate result with referenced item id
  - Given a proposal matching a completed item, the matcher still returns a duplicate result with completed status context
  - Given a proposal with no meaningful overlap, the matcher returns a non-duplicate result and does not block normal flow
- Attach structured duplicate reasons to generated proposals
  Make override decisions understandable by attaching machine-readable and human-readable reason metadata that explains what matched and why the item is considered duplicate.
  - Each duplicate proposal includes reason type, matched item reference, and concise explanation text
  - Reason payload distinguishes match context such as exact title match, semantic match, or completed-item match
  - Non-duplicate proposals do not include duplicate reason metadata

**Force-create Auditability and Visibility**
- 🔶 **Persist override marker metadata on force-created PRD items**
  Create an auditable record that a duplicate guard was overridden, including enough metadata to trace when and why the override happened.
  - Force-created items store an override marker field in persisted PRD data
  - Override marker captures duplicate reason reference and creation timestamp
  - Items created through normal or merge paths do not receive override markers
- ⚠️ **Expose override markers in CLI/status and machine-readable outputs**
  Ensure override decisions are visible to operators and automation so duplicate exceptions can be reviewed and governed.
  - Rex status/output surfaces an indicator for items created via force-create override
  - JSON outputs include override marker fields without breaking existing schema consumers
  - Output clearly differentiates override-created items from merged or normal additions

**Interactive Duplicate Override Decision Flow**
- Implement merge-path application for user-selected duplicate proposals
  Allow users to keep PRD quality high by merging duplicate proposals into existing nodes instead of creating parallel items.
  - Selecting Merge updates the matched existing node rather than creating a new duplicate node
  - Merged result preserves existing node identity and records which proposal was merged
  - Cancelled proposals are not written when user chooses Merge for only a subset
- Implement force-create path that bypasses duplicate block after explicit confirmation
  Support intentional duplication for edge cases by allowing users to proceed anyway, while making the action explicit and auditable.
  - Selecting Proceed anyway creates new items even when duplicate reasons are present
  - Force-create requires explicit selection from the duplicate prompt and is never the default path
  - Choosing Cancel exits without writing any new or merged items

- Duplicate Detection and Reason Classification *(feature)*
  Identify when generated add proposals overlap with existing or completed PRD items and produce clear, user-facing duplicate reasons before any write occurs.
- Interactive Duplicate Override Decision Flow *(feature)*
  Require explicit user confirmation when duplicates are detected, with clear choices to cancel, merge with existing work, or force-create anyway.

### Git Credential Helper Opt-In Recovery

**Credential Helper Command Surface**
- Add opt-in git credential helper command to CLI
  Create a dedicated command users can run on demand to diagnose and set up git credentials, so remediation is explicit and repeatable instead of embedded in normal refresh execution.
  - Running the command starts a credential setup workflow only when explicitly invoked
  - The command is discoverable in CLI help output with usage and examples
  - Command exits with code 0 on successful setup checks and non-zero on unrecoverable setup errors
- Implement provider-aware auth checks and login handoff
  Support practical setup paths by checking `gh auth status` when GitHub CLI is available and providing platform credential-manager guidance when it is not, reducing manual troubleshooting.
  - If `gh` is installed, workflow runs `gh auth status` and offers `gh auth login` handoff when unauthenticated
  - If `gh` is not installed, workflow returns OS-specific credential setup guidance text
  - Workflow output distinguishes between authenticated, unauthenticated, and tool-unavailable states

**Non-Interactive Refresh Compatibility**
- 🔶 **Classify git auth failures and attach opt-in remediation hints**
  When refresh fails due to credential or auth issues, return a specific failure classification with a clear suggestion to run the new helper command instead of generic git errors.
  - Auth-related fetch failures map to a dedicated error classification distinct from network/history failures
  - Failure payload includes the exact opt-in helper command users should run next
  - Non-auth git failures do not include credential-helper remediation hints
- 🔶 **Enforce non-interactive default behavior in refresh path**
  Ensure refresh never opens interactive credential flows unless explicitly requested, preventing hangs in CI and preserving existing automation behavior.
  - Default refresh execution does not invoke `gh auth login` or any interactive credential prompt
  - Interactive helper flow runs only through explicit user opt-in command or explicit opt-in flag
  - Integration tests verify CI-like non-TTY refresh continues to fail fast with actionable guidance

- Credential Helper Command Surface *(feature)*
  Provide an explicit, user-invoked path to set up git credentials after authentication-related refresh failures without introducing interactive prompts into default flows.
- Non-Interactive Refresh Compatibility *(feature)*
  Integrate credential helper guidance into failure handling while preserving default non-interactive behavior for automated and scripted refresh runs.

### Git-Independent PR Markdown Generation

**Branch-Scoped Work Evidence Pipeline**
- 🔶 **Implement branch-scoped Rex work item collector**
  Build a collector that selects epics, features, and tasks relevant to the current branch from Rex state so PR summaries are grounded in planned and completed work, not git remote reachability.
  - Collector returns only Rex items associated with the active branch context
  - Collector excludes deleted items and includes status and completion timestamps when present
  - Unit tests cover mixed-branch datasets and verify no cross-branch leakage
- 🔶 **Implement branch-scoped Hench run evidence collector**
  Add a run evidence layer that gathers executed-task context from Hench runs tied to the active branch so generated PR markdown reflects actual execution history.
  - Collector returns Hench runs linked to the active branch and related Rex task IDs
  - Collector surfaces run outcomes and timestamps for summary generation
  - Integration tests validate correct filtering when runs exist for multiple branches
- 🔶 **Replace git-remote dependency in PR markdown refresh flow**
  Refactor the refresh pipeline to use the Rex/Hench branch evidence collectors as the primary and required data source, eliminating dependency on external git repository connectivity.
  - PR markdown refresh completes successfully when remote git fetch is unavailable
  - Refresh path does not invoke remote connectivity checks in normal generation mode
  - Regression tests confirm markdown generation is deterministic from Rex/Hench evidence only

**Work-History Narrative Synthesis**
- Generate PR sections from executed Rex tasks grouped by epic
  Create structured markdown sections that group completed branch work by epic and feature so reviewers can quickly understand scope and intent.
  - Generated markdown includes epic headings and task-level bullet summaries
  - Only completed or explicitly executed tasks are included in the default narrative
  - Snapshot tests verify stable section ordering across repeated runs
- Attach execution evidence badges to summarized tasks
  Annotate summarized tasks with lightweight execution evidence from Hench (for example run status and timestamp) to improve trust in branch-history-based summaries.
  - Each summarized task shows execution evidence when matching Hench data exists
  - Tasks without execution evidence are clearly labeled as no run evidence
  - Tests validate badge rendering for success, failure, and missing-evidence cases

- Branch-Scoped Work Evidence Pipeline *(feature)*
  Make PR markdown generation rely on Rex and Hench artifacts from the active branch instead of repository diff connectivity.
- Work-History Narrative Synthesis *(feature)*
  Generate reviewer-ready PR markdown from completed Rex tasks and corresponding Hench execution history in a consistent structure.

### Hench Process Concurrency Management

**Execution Concurrency Controls**
- Implement configurable maximum concurrent hench processes
  Add configuration setting and enforcement logic to limit the number of simultaneously running hench processes to prevent memory exhaustion from unlimited concurrent execution
  - Configuration option for max concurrent processes (default: 3)
  - Process count tracking prevents spawning beyond limit
  - Returns meaningful error when limit reached
  - Integrates with existing hench configuration system
- Add execution queue for pending tasks when at concurrency limit
  Implement queuing system to hold task execution requests when maximum concurrent processes are already running, with FIFO scheduling and queue status visibility
  - Tasks queue automatically when concurrency limit reached
  - FIFO execution order with priority override support
  - Queue status visible via API and CLI
  - Graceful queue cleanup on shutdown
- Implement hench process pool with reuse to reduce memory overhead
  Create process pooling mechanism to reuse existing Node.js runtimes for multiple task executions instead of spawning fresh processes, reducing memory consumption per task
  - Process pool maintains warm Node.js runtimes
  - Task isolation maintained between reused processes
  - Memory usage reduced by 60%+ for sequential tasks
  - Pool cleanup and refresh on idle timeout

**Resource-Aware Execution Scheduling**
- Monitor system memory usage before spawning hench processes
  Add system memory monitoring to check available memory before allowing new hench process creation, preventing system-wide memory pressure
  - Real-time system memory usage detection

### Init-time LLM Onboarding and Authentication

**Interactive init banner and provider selection**
- 🔶 **Present interactive LLM provider selection screen**
  Add a user-friendly selection prompt during init that allows choosing `codex` or `claude` as the active provider.
  - Init prompt lists exactly `codex` and `claude` as selectable providers
  - Selecting an option persists provider config to project settings
  - If the user cancels selection, init exits with a clear non-zero termination message
- Render branded n-dx banner at init start
  Display a prominent, readable terminal banner before setup prompts so users immediately understand they are in the guided initialization flow.
  - Running `n-dx init` displays a banner before any configuration questions
  - Running `ndx init` displays the same banner output
  - Banner output is suppressed when init is run in non-interactive mode
- Persist selected provider through existing config pathway
  Write provider choice via the unified configuration system so downstream packages resolve the same active vendor without custom init-only state.
  - Selected provider is readable through existing config get command/path
  - Subsequent commands use the selected provider without additional flags
  - Automated test verifies both `codex` and `claude` selections persist correctly

**Provider authentication preflight during init**
- 🔶 **Implement provider-specific auth status checks**
  Run a provider-specific preflight command after selection to determine whether the current shell session is authorized for the selected LLM.
  - Selecting `codex` triggers the codex auth check command
  - Selecting `claude` triggers the claude auth check command
  - Check result is handled as pass/fail with deterministic branching and no uncaught errors
- 🔶 **Prompt provider-specific login command on auth failure**
  When preflight fails, show clear remediation with the exact login command for the chosen provider so users can complete setup immediately.
  - If codex auth check fails, init prints codex login instruction
  - If claude auth check fails, init prints claude login instruction
  - Prompt message includes next-step guidance and does not continue silently
- Add integration tests for authenticated and unauthenticated init flows
  Cover both provider branches with mocked auth outcomes to prevent regressions in setup logic and ensure login prompting behavior remains reliable.
  - Test suite includes pass/fail auth scenarios for both `codex` and `claude`
  - Authenticated flow completes init without login prompt
  - Unauthenticated flow emits expected provider-specific login prompt text

- Interactive init banner and provider selection *(feature)*
  Make `n-dx init`/`ndx init` guide first-time setup with a prominent terminal banner and a clear LLM provider picker so users can configure execution without manual config edits.
- Provider authentication preflight during init *(feature)*
  After provider selection, validate that the current terminal session is authenticated for that provider and guide users to the correct login command when needed.

### Live PR Markdown in SourceVision UI

**Live Refresh and Graceful Degradation**
- 🔶 **Implement auto-refresh triggers for file and git diff changes**
  Update the tab content automatically when the working tree or diff baseline changes so users always see current PR text without manual refresh.
  - PR markdown refreshes automatically when tracked files change
  - PR markdown refreshes automatically when git status/diff output changes
  - Refresh logic debounces rapid changes to avoid duplicate renders
  - UI shows timestamp of last successful refresh
- Handle unavailable git data with explicit fallback states
  Prevent broken UI behavior when running outside a git repo or when git commands fail by showing actionable fallback messaging.
  - When git executable is missing, tab displays a clear unsupported-state message
  - When current directory is not a git repository, tab shows a no-repo message
  - When base branch cannot be resolved, tab still renders with partial metadata and warning
  - Error states do not crash SourceVision server or other tabs
- Add integration tests for refresh behavior and fallback scenarios
  Protect the new workflow against regressions by covering normal refresh, dirty state updates, and git failure paths end-to-end.
  - Integration test verifies markdown changes after simulated diff update
  - Integration test verifies dirty/untracked indicators update after status change
  - Integration test verifies fallback UI for non-git workspace
  - All new tests pass in existing test pipeline

**PR Summary Generation Pipeline**
- 🔶 **Implement PR markdown generator for current branch vs main**
  Create a generator that builds a structured markdown summary from git diff output so users can paste directly into pull requests without manual rewriting.
  - Generates markdown from `main...HEAD` comparison when git data is available
  - Includes sections for overview, changed files, and notable change summaries
  - Output is plain markdown text with no HTML-only formatting dependencies
  - Generator returns deterministic section order for identical git input
- Include explicit base branch and commit metadata in generated summary
  Ensure users can verify exactly what baseline the summary compares against by embedding branch and commit identifiers in the markdown header.
  - Markdown includes base branch name and base commit SHA
  - Markdown includes current HEAD commit SHA
  - When base resolution fails, markdown displays a fallback marker instead of empty values
  - Metadata appears at the top of the summary in a dedicated section
- Incorporate dirty and untracked file state into PR summary
  Expose local-only working tree changes so the summary reflects what users actually see before committing, reducing mismatch between UI and repository state.
  - Summary includes a section listing modified but unstaged files
  - Summary includes a section listing untracked files
  - Dirty/untracked sections are omitted or marked none when not present
  - Working tree state is refreshed from current git status at generation time

**SourceVision PR Markdown Tab Experience**
- ⚠️ **Add PR Markdown tab to SourceVision navigation and routing**
  Expose a first-class tab so users can find PR-ready output without leaving SourceVision or running separate commands.
  - Sidebar or section navigation includes a PR Markdown entry under SourceVision
  - Selecting the tab updates URL/hash routing consistently with existing patterns
  - Tab loads without breaking existing SourceVision views
  - Tab displays initial loading, success, and empty states
- Render copy-ready markdown preview with raw text access
  Provide a readable preview and direct raw markdown copy path so users can quickly transfer content into pull request descriptions.
  - UI shows rendered markdown preview and corresponding raw markdown text
  - Copy action places full raw markdown content on clipboard
  - Copied content preserves headings, lists, and code fences
  - Copy control provides visible success/failure feedback

- PR Summary Generation Pipeline *(feature)*
  Generate a reliable markdown PR summary from current branch changes against main, including clear base reference metadata.
- SourceVision PR Markdown Tab Experience *(feature)*
  Add a dedicated, easy-to-access UI surface in localhost that continuously presents the latest PR markdown and supports quick copy/paste workflows.
- Live Refresh and Graceful Degradation *(feature)*
  Keep PR markdown current as repository state changes, while failing safely when git context is unavailable.

### LLM Client Circular Dependency Resolution

**Circular Dependency Analysis and Planning**
- ⚠️ **Review sourcevision circular dependency findings for llm-client package**
  ## Findings

Sourcevision analysis (2026-02-24T05:11:49, git sha 536ec50) detected **4 circular dependency chains** in `packages/llm-client/src/`.

### Root Cycle

All 4 chains are sub-paths of a single root cycle:

```
provider-interface.ts → llm-types.ts → create-client.ts → api-provider.ts → provider-interface.ts
provider-interface.ts → llm-types.ts → create-client.ts → cli-provider.ts → provider-interface.ts
```

### Dependency Graph (pre-fix)

```
provider-interface.ts ──imports LLMVendor──→ llm-types.ts
       ↑                                          │
       │                              imports CreateClientOptions
       │                                          ↓
 api/cli-provider.ts ←──provides factory── create-client.ts
       │
       └──imports LLMProvider──→ provider-interface.ts
```

### The 4 Chains Reported

1. `api-provider.ts → provider-interface.ts → llm-types.ts → create-client.ts`
2. `api-provider.ts → provider-interface.ts → llm-types.ts → create-client.ts` (type import duplicate)
3. `provider-interface.ts → llm-types.ts → create-client.ts`
4. `cli-provider.ts → provider-interface.ts → llm-types.ts → create-client.ts`

### Affected Modules

- `provider-interface.ts` — LLMProvider interface + (was) LLMVendor consumer
- `llm-types.ts` — vendor-neutral types + (was) LLMVendor definition
- `create-client.ts` — Claude dual-provider factory
- `api-provider.ts` — Anthropic SDK provider
- `cli-provider.ts` — Claude CLI provider

### Root Cause

`provider-interface.ts` imported `LLMVendor` from `llm-types.ts`. `llm-types.ts` imported `CreateClientOptions` from `create-client.ts`. Both providers imported `LLMProvider` from `provider-interface.ts` to implement it. This formed a structural cycle even though all cross-layer imports were `import type`.

### Resolution (already applied in prior session)

`LLMVendor` was moved from `llm-types.ts` to `provider-interface.ts` as a self-contained definition. `llm-types.ts` re-exports it for backward compatibility. The `provider-interface.ts → llm-types.ts` import edge was eliminated, breaking all 4 chains. Zero circular dependencies remain.
  - All circular dependency cycles in llm-client are documented with affected modules
  - Dependency graph visualization shows current circular relationships
  - Root causes of each circular dependency are identified
- ⚠️ **Design dependency refactoring strategy for llm-client**
  ## Dependency Refactoring Strategy: llm-client Circular Dependency Resolution

### Problem Statement
Sourcevision identified 4 circular dependency chains in packages/llm-client, all rooted in one cycle:
  provider-interface.ts → llm-types.ts → create-client.ts → (api|cli)-provider.ts → provider-interface.ts

### Root Cause Analysis
The cycle formed through these steps:
1. provider-interface.ts imported LLMVendor from llm-types.ts
2. llm-types.ts imported CreateClientOptions (type) from create-client.ts
3. create-client.ts imported createApiClient/createCliClient from provider modules
4. Provider modules imported LLMProvider/ProviderInfo from provider-interface.ts

### Dependency Layer Hierarchy
The llm-client module has 7 distinct layers:
- Layer 0 (foundation): types.ts, exec.ts, output.ts, json.ts, help-format.ts, suggest.ts
- Layer 1 (interfaces): provider-interface.ts — generic LLMProvider contract
- Layer 2 (config): config.ts, llm-config.ts
- Layer 3 (providers): api-provider.ts, cli-provider.ts, codex-cli-provider.ts
- Layer 4 (factories): create-client.ts, llm-client.ts
- Layer 5 (management): provider-registry.ts, provider-session.ts
- Layer 6 (aggregation): llm-types.ts, public.ts

### Strategy: Type Relocation via Dependency Inversion
**Chosen approach**: Move LLMVendor from Layer 6 (llm-types.ts) to Layer 1 (provider-interface.ts), then re-export from llm-types.ts for backward compatibility.

**Rationale**:
- LLMVendor identifies which vendor a provider implements — it belongs with the provider interface contract
- provider-interface.ts is the lowest layer that uses the type (ProviderInfo.vendor: LLMVendor)
- Re-exporting from llm-types.ts ensures zero breaking changes for existing consumers

**Alternatives considered and rejected**:
1. Extract to vendors.ts (new file): Adds a new file for a two-value type union; hard to discover
2. Move CreateClientOptions to llm-types.ts: Makes llm-types.ts import from factories (wrong direction)
3. Use import type everywhere: Already applied but does not break structural/tool-detected cycles
4. Split provider-interface.ts: Over-engineering; the file is small and cohesive

### Modules Changed
- provider-interface.ts: +8 lines — define and export LLMVendor with explanatory comment
- llm-types.ts: +2 lines — import LLMVendor from provider-interface.ts and re-export it

### Backward Compatibility
- All consumers of LLMVendor from @n-dx/llm-client continue to work unchanged
- public.ts exports unchanged
- No changes required in dependent packages (hench, rex, sourcevision, web, claude-client)

### Verification
- 323/323 tests pass in @n-dx/llm-client after the fix
- Runtime import graph: no circular dependencies remain
- Type-only imports (import type) form no runtime cycles and are safe
- Sourcevision circular dependency chain count: 4 → 0
  - Refactoring plan specifies which modules to split or merge
  - Strategy identifies shared abstractions to extract
  - Plan maintains backward compatibility for public API
  - Approach minimizes impact on dependent packages

**Dependency Refactoring Implementation**
- ⚠️ **Update package exports to maintain public API compatibility**
  Ensure that public API exports remain consistent after internal restructuring, updating index files and package.json exports as needed
  - All public exports remain available at same paths
  - Package.json exports configuration is updated correctly
  - No breaking changes to external consumers
  - Internal reorganization is transparent to users
- Extract shared types and interfaces to break circular dependencies
  Circular dependencies fully resolved. LLMVendor moved to provider-interface.ts (commit 0862f2d). All 4 cycles broken. TypeScript passes (0 errors). 323 tests pass. Public API unchanged via re-export.
  - All shared types are moved to non-circular locations
  - Type imports no longer create circular references
  - Public API surface remains unchanged
  - All existing type references are updated
- Reorganize module imports to follow dependency hierarchy
  Restructure imports within llm-client to ensure unidirectional dependency flow, potentially splitting large modules or creating new abstraction layers
  - All modules follow clear dependency hierarchy
  - No circular imports remain in the package
  - Module responsibilities are clearly separated
  - Import structure supports maintainability
- Log *(subtask)*

**Validation and Testing**
- 🔶 **Validate circular dependency resolution with sourcevision re-analysis**
  Run sourcevision analysis again on the refactored llm-client package to confirm all circular dependencies have been eliminated and no new issues were introduced
  - Sourcevision analysis shows zero circular dependencies in llm-client
  - No new architectural issues are introduced
  - Dependency graph shows clean unidirectional flow
  - Analysis report confirms resolution of all identified cycles
- 🔶 **Execute comprehensive test suite to ensure functionality preservation**
  Test results: llm-client 323/323 tests pass. claude-client 211/211 tests pass. hench 912/912 tests pass (after fixing stale help text assertion). rex 2291/2300 tests pass (after fixing modify-reason.test.ts mock to use createLLMClient/detectLLMAuthMode). Pre-existing failures noted: feature-filtered-task.test.ts (9 failures for unimplemented featureId filter, commit 90442f0 Feb 13 2026) and sourcevision cli-serve.test.ts (1 e2e timeout, environment limitation). Commit: 3a5556b

### LoE-Calibrated Proposal Generation in rex add

**LoE Threshold-Driven Proposal Decomposition**
- Implement configurable LoE threshold and automatic decomposition pass
  Introduce an loe.taskThresholdWeeks key (default: 2) into the rex configuration system and wire it through ndx config for reading, setting, and validation. Implement the decomposition pass: after the initial proposal step, identify items whose loe exceeds the threshold and run a secondary LLM call per item to produce child proposals, each with their own LoE estimates. Recursively decompose children that still exceed the threshold up to a configurable depth limit (default: 2 levels).
  - ndx config loe.taskThresholdWeeks returns the current value (default: 2)
  - ndx config loe.taskThresholdWeeks 3 updates and persists the value to the config file
  - Negative or non-numeric values are rejected with a helpful validation error
  - The key appears in ndx config --help output with a description and default value
  - Items with loe > loe.taskThresholdWeeks trigger the decomposition pass automatically
  - Decomposition LLM call produces child items whose individual LoE values fall at or below the threshold
  - Each child item carries its own loe, loeRationale, and loeConfidence
  - Items already at or below the threshold are not decomposed
  - Decomposition depth is capped at a configurable limit (default: 2 levels) to prevent runaway recursion
- Add decomposition confirmation UI to proposal review workflow
  When decomposition has occurred for a proposal item, present the decomposed children indented beneath their parent during the review step. The user can accept the decomposed version (adds children, discards the parent), keep the original consolidated item, or skip entirely. Non-interactive mode defaults to accepting decomposed items. Output should clearly label which items were auto-decomposed and the LoE value that triggered decomposition.
  - Decomposed children are shown indented beneath their parent item in the review output
  - Review prompt offers three choices for decomposed items: accept decomposed, keep original, skip
  - Choosing 'accept decomposed' adds child items to the PRD and does not add the parent
  - Choosing 'keep original' adds the parent item unmodified
  - Non-interactive (--yes) mode defaults to accepting the decomposed version
  - Review output labels auto-decomposed items with the LoE value that triggered decomposition

**LoE-Aware Consolidated Proposal Generation**
- Redesign proposal schema and LLM prompt to elicit consolidated, LoE-estimated proposals
  Add optional loe (number, engineer-weeks), loeRationale (string), and loeConfidence ('low'|'medium'|'high') fields to the proposal item Zod schema, then revise the rex add system prompt to (a) generate consolidated, sprint-sized work packages (3–7 items for broad input) rather than micro-tasks, and (b) return structured LoE estimates as JSON fields with a worked example. Prompt wording should be isolated in a named constant or template file for independent iteration.
  - Proposal item Zod schema includes loe, loeRationale, and loeConfidence as optional fields
  - Existing proposals without LoE fields parse without error
  - LoE fields round-trip correctly through proposal serialization and PRD item creation
  - tsc --noEmit passes with no new type errors after the schema change
  - System prompt explicitly instructs the LLM to prefer consolidated proposals; sample outputs for broad input produce 3–7 high-level items rather than 10+ micro-tasks
  - Prompt explicitly requests loe, loeRationale, and loeConfidence as structured JSON fields and includes a worked example
  - Prompt wording is isolated in a named constant or template file
- Add post-processing consolidation guard and LoE display to proposal review
  After the LLM returns proposals, apply a post-processing pass that detects over-granular output (item count exceeds a configurable ceiling, default 10) and triggers a secondary re-consolidation prompt as a safety net. Additionally, update the interactive proposal review CLI to show loe and loeRationale for each item, visually flagging items that exceed the decomposition threshold so reviewers can make informed decisions before accepting.
  - Post-processing detects when proposal item count exceeds a configurable ceiling (default: 10 items per input description)
  - Over-granular results trigger a secondary LLM consolidation pass using a defined re-prompt template
  - Consolidation pass reduces item count to within the ceiling or emits a labeled warning if it cannot
  - The ceiling value is configurable via rex config and exposed in ndx config --help
  - Proposal review output shows loe value and rationale for each item that carries LoE data
  - Items with loe exceeding the configured decomposition threshold are flagged with a visible indicator
  - Items without LoE data display cleanly without empty brackets or missing-field noise
  - LoE display is consistent between interactive and --yes (non-interactive) modes

- LoE-Aware Consolidated Proposal Generation *(feature)*
  Enhance the rex add proposal pipeline so the LLM produces fewer, larger work packages by default and attaches structured LoE estimates (engineer-weeks, rationale, confidence) to each item. Changes span the proposal Zod schema, the system prompt, post-processing guardrails, and the CLI review display.
- LoE Threshold-Driven Proposal Decomposition *(feature)*
  Implement an automatic decomposition pass that splits proposal items exceeding the LoE threshold into smaller child items. The threshold defaults to 2 engineer-weeks and is user-configurable. Decomposed items are presented inline in the review so users can accept children, keep the original, or skip entirely.

### Memory-Aware Polling Loop Management

**Memory Pressure Polling Suspension**
- Wire memory pressure flag to loader polling suspension
  Connect the existing isFeatureDisabled(autoRefresh) flag to call stopPolling() in loader.ts when memory pressure reaches 50% threshold
  - Loader 5s polling stops when isFeatureDisabled(autoRefresh) returns true
  - stopPolling() function is invoked from memory degradation system
  - Loader polling remains stopped until memory pressure subsides
- Suspend status indicator polling during memory pressure
  Stop the 10s status-indicator polling loop when memory pressure is detected to minimize background processing
  - Status indicator polling stops when isFeatureDisabled(autoRefresh) is true
  - No status update requests during memory pressure
  - Status indicator shows last known state without updates

**Memory-Aware Polling Validation**
- Add integration tests for memory-aware polling suspension
  Create tests that simulate memory pressure conditions and verify all polling loops are properly suspended and restarted
  - Tests verify all three polling loops stop under simulated memory pressure
  - Tests confirm polling restart when memory pressure clears
  - Tests validate no resource leaks during suspension/restart cycles
- Add polling suspension status indicators
  Display UI indicators when polling is suspended due to memory pressure to inform users of degraded functionality
  - Visual indicator shows when polling is suspended due to memory pressure
  - Indicator explains why auto-refresh is disabled
  - Manual refresh options remain available during suspension

**Polling Restart and Recovery Logic**
- Add polling state management and cleanup
  Implement centralized polling state management to prevent orphaned intervals and ensure clean suspension/restart cycles
  - All polling intervals are tracked and can be cleanly stopped
  - No memory leaks from orphaned polling intervals
  - Polling state persists across component remounts during memory pressure

- Memory Pressure Polling Suspension *(feature)*
  Integrate memory pressure detection with active polling loops to prevent resource consumption during high memory usage
- Polling Restart and Recovery Logic *(feature)*
  Implement automatic polling restart when memory pressure subsides to restore normal UI functionality
- Memory-Aware Polling Validation *(feature)*
  Add testing and monitoring to ensure polling suspension works correctly under memory pressure scenarios

### ndx Dashboard Refresh Orchestration

**Dashboard Data and PR Markdown Refresh Flow**
- 🔶 **Implement SourceVision-derived dashboard artifact refresh step**
  Add orchestration logic that refreshes generated dashboard artifacts used by the web UI so analysis-derived views stay synchronized with repository state.
  - Default `ndx refresh` runs a data refresh step for SourceVision-derived dashboard artifacts.
  - `ndx refresh --data-only` runs data refresh steps without running UI build steps.
  - A successful run updates artifact timestamps or metadata that can be inspected after completion.
- Integrate PR markdown cache refresh into `ndx refresh` flow
  Wire PR markdown generation/cache refresh into the orchestration pipeline so users can refresh copy-ready PR content from one command.
  - Default `ndx refresh` includes PR markdown cache refresh as part of data refresh.
  - `ndx refresh --pr-markdown` triggers PR markdown cache refresh and skips unrelated steps.
  - If PR markdown refresh fails, command marks that step failed and returns non-zero status while preserving prior step results in output.

**Live Server Compatibility and Operator Feedback**
- Implement running-server detection and live reload signaling during refresh
  Detect active dashboard server context and send reload notifications where supported so users do not need to manually restart after routine refresh operations.
  - When `ndx start` server is running and reload signaling is supported, `ndx refresh` emits a live-reload signal after successful refresh steps.
  - Command output indicates whether live reload was attempted and whether it succeeded.
  - When no server is running, refresh completes without reload errors.
- Add stepwise status reporting and restart fallback guidance
  Provide clear per-step status output and explicit fallback instructions when a full restart is required, reducing ambiguity for operators and CI logs.
  - Each refresh step prints status transitions (started, succeeded, failed, skipped) with step names.
  - When hot reload is unavailable, output includes a restart-required message with the exact restart command.
  - User-facing docs include a `ndx refresh` section describing flags, live reload behavior, and restart fallback conditions.

**Refresh Command Surface and Execution Planning**
- 🔶 **Add `ndx refresh` command to CLI orchestration entrypoint**
  Expose a dedicated refresh command in the top-level CLI so dashboard refresh workflows are accessible without package-specific commands, reducing operator friction and script complexity.
  - `ndx refresh --help` shows the command with supported flags `--ui-only`, `--data-only`, `--pr-markdown`, and `--no-build`.
  - Running `ndx refresh` executes without unknown-command errors from a configured project root.
  - Command exits with code `0` on successful completion and non-zero on any failed step.
- 🔶 **Implement refresh plan builder for flag combinations and conflicts**
  Translate flag combinations into explicit step plans so each invocation has predictable behavior and invalid combinations are rejected before work starts.
  - `--ui-only` skips data refresh steps and executes only UI-related steps.
  - `--data-only` skips UI build steps unless explicitly required by implementation constraints and reports that decision.
  - `--pr-markdown` runs only PR markdown cache refresh path (plus required prerequisites) and skips unrelated steps.
  - `--ui-only` with `--data-only` returns a validation error with actionable guidance.

**UI Build and Asset Refresh Orchestration**
- Implement affected UI package resolver with `@n-dx/web` minimum coverage
  Create build-step resolution that always includes `@n-dx/web` and includes SourceVision-related assets when refresh scope indicates they are needed, preventing stale dashboard views.
  - Default `ndx refresh` includes build execution for `@n-dx/web`.
  - When SourceVision UI assets are required, resolver includes the SourceVision asset build step in the plan.
  - Plan output lists exactly which packages/assets will be built before execution.
- Apply `--no-build` and `--ui-only` semantics to build pipeline execution
  Respect user intent to skip build work or focus on UI work while keeping behavior explicit and safe for automation and local use.
  - `ndx refresh --no-build` skips all build commands and reports build steps as skipped.
  - `ndx refresh --ui-only` executes UI build/asset steps and does not run non-UI data refresh steps.
  - When both `--ui-only --no-build` are provided, command performs no build actions and still prints a valid step summary.

- Refresh Command Surface and Execution Planning *(feature)*
  Introduce a first-class `ndx refresh` command that turns user intent into a deterministic refresh plan across build and data steps.

### PR Markdown Reviewer Context Enrichment

**PRD Epic Attribution in PR Summaries**
- 🔶 **Implement branch-to-PRD work item resolver**
  Create a resolver that maps branch changes to completed or in-progress PRD tasks and derives their parent epic titles, so PR summaries can show intent-level context instead of only code-level changes.
  - Given a branch with linked PRD task activity, resolver returns unique parent epic titles
  - Resolver excludes deleted PRD items and items not touched by branch work
  - Resolver output is deterministic across repeated runs on the same git/PRD state
- Render worked-on epic titles in PR markdown overview
  Add a dedicated section near the top of generated PR markdown that lists PRD epic titles worked on by the branch, so reviewers immediately see strategic scope.
  - Generated markdown includes a 'Worked PRD Epics' section when at least one epic is resolved
  - Epic titles are de-duplicated and presented in stable order
  - When no epic mapping exists, markdown shows a concise fallback message rather than an empty section

**Significant Change Narrative**
- 🔶 **Implement significant-function and feature highlight extraction**
  Add logic to identify newly added or materially changed high-impact functions and user-visible features, enabling summaries that focus on reviewer-relevant changes.
  - Extractor identifies added/modified exported functions and routes/components touched in the branch
  - Output includes concise rationale for why each highlight is significant
  - Low-signal refactors (e.g., rename-only or formatting-only diffs) are excluded from highlights
- Generate reviewer-first overview section without file/line enumerations
  Update markdown generation to present a compact narrative of important changes and explicitly avoid long file-by-file or line-by-line lists that reduce review clarity.
  - Default PR markdown contains an 'Important Changes' narrative section with feature/function summaries
  - Default output does not include exhaustive per-file change listings or line-count tables
  - Integration tests fail if generator reintroduces long file/line enumeration patterns in default mode

- PRD Epic Attribution in PR Summaries *(feature)*
  Connect branch work to PRD context so reviewers can quickly understand which planned initiatives the changes implement.
- Significant Change Narrative *(feature)*
  Shift PR markdown toward human-readable explanation of important functional and feature-level changes, minimizing noisy implementation detail.

### PR Markdown View Toggle and Copy UX

**Copy-to-Clipboard Workflow**
- Add one-click copy action for raw markdown content
  Implement a dedicated copy button that copies the full generated markdown to clipboard so users can paste directly into PR comments.
  - Clicking copy places the complete raw markdown text on the clipboard
  - Copy action is available in Raw mode without selecting text manually
  - Automated UI test verifies clipboard write call with exact markdown payload
- Render copy status and fallback guidance
  Show immediate success/error feedback for clipboard operations and provide fallback instructions when browser permissions block clipboard access.
  - Successful copy displays a visible confirmation message
  - Clipboard failures display an error message with manual copy guidance
  - Tests cover success and permission-denied clipboard scenarios

**Single-Pane Preview/Raw Toggle**
- Refactor PR markdown panel to single-pane mode
  Update the PR markdown tab layout so only one representation is shown at a time, reducing visual clutter and improving focus.
  - UI renders either Preview or Raw mode, never both simultaneously
  - Default mode is Preview after opening or refreshing the tab
  - Responsive tests confirm correct layout on mobile and desktop widths
- Implement explicit Preview/Raw toggle control with persisted state
  Add a clear toggle control so users can switch modes quickly, and persist their last-used mode during the session for convenience.
  - Toggle control switches mode without page reload
  - Selected mode persists across tab re-renders within the same session
  - Accessibility checks confirm keyboard navigation and ARIA state updates

- Single-Pane Preview/Raw Toggle *(feature)*
  Replace side-by-side rendering with a single-pane mode switch between rendered preview and raw markdown.
- Copy-to-Clipboard Workflow *(feature)*
  Provide a reliable one-click copy action for raw PR markdown with clear success and failure feedback.

### Process Lifecycle Management and Graceful Shutdown

**Dead Connection Detection and Cleanup**
- Implement immediate WebSocket disconnect detection
  Replace the 30-second ping/pong cycle with immediate connection state monitoring to detect client disconnections as soon as they occur
  - WebSocket disconnect events are detected within 1 second of occurrence
  - Dead connections are identified before the next broadcast attempt
  - Connection state monitoring has minimal performance overhead
- Remove dead clients from broadcast set immediately
  Automatically prune disconnected clients from the active broadcast list to prevent wasted serialization and write operations
  - Dead clients are removed from broadcast set within 1 second of disconnect detection
  - Broadcast operations skip dead clients entirely
  - Memory usage decreases immediately when clients disconnect
- Optimize broadcast operations for active connections only
  Ensure JSON serialization and socket write operations only target verified active connections to eliminate wasted CPU cycles
  - JSON.stringify is only called for confirmed active connections
  - Socket write attempts are eliminated for dead connections
  - Broadcast performance scales with active connection count, not total connection history
- Add WebSocket connection health monitoring dashboard
  Create visibility into WebSocket connection health, cleanup metrics, and resource usage to monitor the effectiveness of dead connection removal
  - Dashboard shows active vs total connection counts in real-time
  - Cleanup success rate and timing metrics are displayed
  - Resource usage trends are visible before and after cleanup improvements

**Graceful Shutdown Implementation**
- 🔶 **Implement unified signal handler with cascading cleanup**
  Implemented unified signal handler with cascading cleanup (commit cb60d1c). Changes: (1) packages/web/src/server/start.ts: extracted registerShutdownHandlers() as an exported testable function with 30s overall timeout (configurable via N_DX_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS env var), double-signal handling (second SIGINT/SIGTERM forces immediate exit(1) while graceful shutdown is still running), signal name in logs, and injectable exit dep for testing. The function runs cleanup in dependency order: hench child processes first then WebSocket connections then HTTP server then port file. (2) packages/web/tests/unit/server/shutdown-handler.test.ts: 13 new unit tests covering signal handler registration, cleanup ordering, SIGINT/SIGTERM name logging, double-signal force-exit, timeout force-exit, timeout error message, port file removal, and completion log.
  - Single signal handler coordinates shutdown across all processes
  - Cleanup procedures execute in proper dependency order
  - Timeout mechanisms prevent indefinite shutdown hangs
- 🔶 **Add process tree cleanup with force termination fallback**
  Implement comprehensive child process cleanup that gracefully terminates processes with force-kill fallback for unresponsive processes
  - All child processes are gracefully terminated on shutdown
  - Force termination kicks in after configurable timeout
  - Process tree is fully cleaned up before main process exits
- 🔶 **Implement port cleanup and resource release procedures**
  Add explicit port unbinding and resource cleanup procedures that execute during graceful shutdown to prevent port conflicts
  - All bound ports are explicitly released on shutdown
  - File handles and system resources are properly closed
  - Cleanup procedures log success/failure status
- Add shutdown status reporting and verification
  Implement status reporting during shutdown process and verification that cleanup completed successfully
  - Shutdown progress is logged with component-specific status
  - Cleanup verification confirms all processes terminated
  - Failed cleanup attempts are logged with diagnostic information

**Lingering Process Investigation and Root Cause Analysis**
- Audit current dashboard process spawning and lifecycle management
  Analyze all process creation points in the dashboard startup flow, including child processes, worker threads, and port bindings to understand the current architecture
  - Complete inventory of all processes spawned during dashboard startup
  - Documentation of current cleanup procedures and signal handlers
  - Identification of processes that lack proper cleanup
- Identify and catalog all port bindings and resource allocations
  Map all network ports, file handles, and system resources allocated during dashboard operation to understand what needs cleanup
  - Complete list of all ports bound during dashboard operation
  - Inventory of file handles and system resources allocated
  - Documentation of current resource cleanup procedures
- Analyze signal handling and termination procedures across all packages
  Review current SIGINT, SIGTERM, and other signal handling implementations across web, hench, rex, and sourcevision packages
  - Audit of all existing signal handlers in the codebase
  - Documentation of cleanup procedures triggered by signals
  - Identification of packages lacking proper signal handling
- Fix GAP-1: export shutdownRexExecution from routes-rex.ts and wire into start.ts gracefulShutdown *(subtask)*

**Refresh Command Process Management**
- Add pre-refresh process conflict detection and resolution
  Implement detection of existing dashboard processes during refresh and provide automated cleanup before proceeding with refresh operations
  - Existing dashboard processes are detected before refresh starts
  - Automated cleanup procedures terminate conflicting processes
  - Refresh proceeds only after successful cleanup verification
- Implement robust port availability checking with retry logic
  Implemented robust port availability checking with retry logic (commit d955530). Added checkPortWithRetry() to packages/web/src/server/port.ts with configurable exponential backoff (maxRetries, retryDelayMs, backoffFactor). Updated findAvailablePort() to accept optional retryOpts parameter (backward compatible). Wired retry options into startServer() in start.ts (maxRetries=5, retryDelayMs=100, backoffFactor=2) so recently stopped server ports get up to ~3s to clear before fallback. Exported new API from server/index.ts and public.ts. Added 6 new tests covering: immediate success, retry-and-succeed on port release, exhausted retries, maxRetries=0 edge case, findAvailablePort with retryOpts recovering preferred port, and fallback after exhausted retries. All 15 port tests pass. Pre-existing failures noted: sidebar.test.ts (localStorage mock env issue) and routes-hench.ts TS error (killWithFallback import) are both pre-existing.
  - Port availability is verified before attempting to bind
  - Retry logic handles timing issues during process transitions
  - Clear error messages provided when ports remain unavailable
- Add refresh operation cleanup validation and rollback
  Implement validation procedures that verify successful refresh completion and provide rollback mechanisms for failed refresh attempts
  - Refresh success is validated before marking operation complete
  - Rollback procedures restore previous state on failure
  - Clear status reporting throughout refresh lifecycle

  Implement immediate detection and removal of disconnected WebSocket clients to prevent resource waste

### Project-aware Navigation and Context

**Top-level Token Usage Navigation**
- 🔶 **Preserve legacy deep links by routing old Token Usage URLs to the new top-level destination**
  Existing bookmarks and shared links must continue working so teams do not lose access patterns after the navigation restructure.
  - Legacy Token Usage route patterns resolve to the new top-level Token Usage destination
  - URL normalization preserves query params and hash fragments used by existing links
  - No 404 or blank-state regressions occur when opening previously valid deep links
- Add Token Usage as a peer top-level nav item to Settings
  Users need direct access to utilization analytics from primary navigation rather than discovering it inside Rex-specific views; this change improves findability and reinforces Token Usage as a cross-tool concern.
  - Main dashboard navigation renders a Token Usage item at the same hierarchy level as Settings
  - Selecting Token Usage loads the existing Token Usage view content without regressions in data rendering
  - Navigation ordering and visibility are deterministic across page reloads
- Align active-state highlighting with normalized Token Usage routes
  Active-state logic must remain trustworthy after route remapping so users always see accurate location context in navigation.
  - Token Usage nav item is highlighted for both new and legacy-normalized Token Usage URLs
  - Settings and other top-level items are not highlighted when Token Usage is active
  - Automated tests cover active-state behavior for direct load, in-app navigation, and legacy deep-link entry

- ⚠️ **Top-level Token Usage Navigation** *(feature)*
  Expose Token Usage as a first-class dashboard destination at the same hierarchy level as Settings without breaking existing navigation contracts.

### Recursive zone architecture

**Full-pipeline zone subdivision**
- ⚠️ **Add subCrossings field to Zone schema**
  Add optional subCrossings?: ZoneCrossing[] to Zone interface in packages/sourcevision/src/schema/v1.ts.
  - Zone interface has optional subCrossings?: ZoneCrossing[]
  - Field populated during subdivision
  - Existing consumers unaffected (non-breaking)
- 🔶 **Extract runZonePipeline from analyzeZones**
  Extract the shared Louvain pipeline steps (buildUndirectedGraph, proximity edges, louvainPhase1, mergeBidirectionalCoupling, mergeSmallCommunities, capZoneCount, splitLargeCommunities, mergeSameIdCommunities, buildZonesFromCommunities, recursive subdivideZone, buildCrossings, assignByProximity) into a reusable runZonePipeline function in packages/sourcevision/src/analyzers/zones.ts. Accepts ZonePipelineOptions {edges, inventory, imports, scopeFiles, maxZones?, maxZonePercent?, parentId?, depth?, testFiles?} and returns ZonePipelineResult {zones, crossings, unzoned}.
  - Shared function encapsulates Louvain pipeline steps
  - analyzeZones refactored to call runZonePipeline
  - All existing tests pass with identical output
  - Function accepts maxZones, maxZonePercent, parentId, depth params
- 🔶 **Rewrite subdivideZone to use full pipeline**
  Replace the stripped-down Louvain in subdivideZone with a runZonePipeline call. Filter imports.edges to zone's internal edges, pass zone.files as scopeFiles, maxZones: 8, parentId: zone.id, depth: depth + 1. Prefix sub-zone IDs with zone.id/. Compute sub-crossings and store on zone.subCrossings. Thread testFiles through to subdivision.
  - subdivideZone calls runZonePipeline instead of stripped-down Louvain
  - Resolution escalation active during subdivision
  - Proximity edges added for non-import files within zone
  - mergeSameIdCommunities prevents duplicate sub-zone names
  - Sub-crossings computed and stored on zone.subCrossings
  - testFiles exclusion propagated to sub-zone metrics
- Update zone-output.ts for sub-crossings
  In packages/sourcevision/src/analyzers/zone-output.ts, add a <sub-crossings> section to zone context.md generation showing cross-dependency counts between sub-zones grouped by zone pair.
  - Zone context.md includes sub-crossings section when present
  - Shows cross-dependency counts grouped by zone pair
- Add subdivision enhancement tests
  New test file packages/sourcevision/tests/unit/analyzers/zone-subdivision.test.ts plus updates to existing zone-detection.test.ts.
  - Tests for sub-crossings computation between sub-zones
  - Tests for resolution escalation at subdivision level
  - Tests for proximity edges at subdivision level
  - Tests for mergeSameIdCommunities at subdivision level
  - Tests for recursive multi-depth subdivision with sub-crossings
  - Tests for testFiles exclusion propagation to sub-zone metrics
  - End-to-end test: analyzeZones produces subCrossings on large zones
  - Regression test: refactored pipeline produces identical output on existing fixtures

**Multi-repo workspace aggregation**
- Design workspace command and config format
- Implement workspace zone builder
- Implement cross-repo crossing computation

**Web viewer zone drill-down**
- Add drill-down types and navigation state
  In packages/web/src/viewer/views/zone-types.ts, add ZoneBreadcrumb {zoneId: string | null; label: string} interface. Extend ZoneData with subZones?: ZoneData[], subCrossings?: FlowEdge[], hasDrillDown?: boolean. In packages/web/src/viewer/views/zones.ts, add drillPath state (stack of ZoneBreadcrumb[]) starting at [{zoneId: null, label: 'All Zones'}]. Derive visibleZones and visibleCrossings from current drill level.
  - ZoneBreadcrumb type defined
  - ZoneData extended with subZones, subCrossings, hasDrillDown
  - drillPath state in ZonesView with derived visibleZones/visibleCrossings
- Implement breadcrumb navigation component
  Render breadcrumbs above diagram when drillPath.length > 1. Clicking a breadcrumb pops back to that level. Hidden at root level.
  - Breadcrumbs render above diagram when drilled in
  - Clicking breadcrumb navigates back to that level
  - Hidden at root level (no unnecessary UI)
- Add drill-down interaction to zone boxes
  Add drill-down arrow button on zone boxes that have subZones. Click pushes new breadcrumb, re-renders diagram with sub-zones. Reset expanded zones on drill. Zone cards use visibleZones. Summary line reflects current drill level.
  - Zones with subZones show drill-down affordance
  - Clicking drill-down pushes breadcrumb and renders sub-zones
  - Zone cards update to show sub-zone data
  - Summary line reflects current drill level
- Add drill-down tests
  New test file packages/web/tests/unit/viewer/zone-drill-down.test.ts.
  - Tests for breadcrumb rendering
  - Tests for sub-zone diagram rendering after drill-down
  - Tests for back navigation restoring parent view
  - Tests for nested 3-level drill-down
  - Tests for buildFlowEdges working with sub-crossings

- Full-pipeline zone subdivision *(feature)*
  Phase 1: Make subdivideZone use the same full Louvain pipeline as root analysis, with sub-crossings computation.
- Web viewer zone drill-down *(feature)*
  Phase 2: Add drill-down navigation in the web viewer so users can explore sub-zones interactively with breadcrumb navigation.
- Multi-repo workspace aggregation *(feature)*
  Phase 3 (future): sourcevision workspace [dirs...] command. Each repo's analysis becomes a top-level zone. Cross-repo crossings from external import resolution. The fractal property from Phase 1/2 makes this a data assembly problem.

### Resolve critical SourceVision architectural findings

**Address pattern issues (9 findings)**
- 🔶 **Extract viewer infrastructure into organized subdirectories**
  Move 19 root-level infrastructure files from viewer/ into logical subdirectories: viewer/performance/ (DOM optimization, memory, crash, degradation, gates), viewer/polling/ (state, manager, restart, visibility, tick, refresh), viewer/messaging/ (coalescer, throttle, rate limiter, dedup). Update all import paths. Add barrel exports. Addresses findings: cross-cutting performance concerns, oversized catch-all zone, god-zone pattern, missing abstraction layers.
  - No infrastructure files remain at viewer/ root (only main.ts, types.ts, utils.ts, route-state.ts, sourcevision-tabs.ts, schema-compat.ts, loader.ts)
  - Files organized into viewer/performance/, viewer/polling/, viewer/messaging/
  - All import paths updated and build passes
  - Tests pass with no regressions
- Fix foundation zone boundaries and standardize abstraction patterns
  Address ui-foundation anti-pattern (web-7): domain-specific views mixed with infrastructure primitives. Standardize hook vs direct coupling patterns across UI zones. Addresses findings: foundation anti-pattern, inconsistent service abstraction patterns, inconsistent hook patterns.
  - Foundation layer contains only infrastructure primitives, not domain views
  - Consistent hook abstraction pattern across all infrastructure services
  - Build and tests pass
- Fix schema-infrastructure client-server boundary violation
  Clean separation between schema/ validation (server-side contracts) and viewer/ data loading (client-side). Address the zone violation where schema files are grouped with viewer files. Addresses findings: client-server boundary violation, domain boundary sprawl.
  - Schema validation imports do not cross into viewer data-loading layer
  - Clean import boundaries between schema/ and viewer/
  - Build and tests pass

**Address suggestion issues (11 findings)**
- 🔶 **Implement architectural risk scoring module in sourcevision**
  Consolidates 5 overlapping suggestions about architectural risk thresholds into a single risk scoring module. Add risk metrics to zones, classify zones into risk levels, and generate structured findings. Standardize on cohesion < 0.4 AND coupling > 0.6 as the governance threshold.
  - New risk-scoring.ts analyzer module computes risk scores for all zones
  - Zones get riskLevel classification: healthy | at-risk | critical | catastrophic
  - Risk thresholds are configurable constants (cohesion < 0.4, coupling > 0.6)
  - Zone schema type includes riskScore and riskLevel fields
  - Risk findings are emitted for zones exceeding thresholds
  - Unit tests cover risk scoring logic
  - Build and typecheck pass
- Consolidate token usage files into dedicated zone boundary
  Move scattered token usage functionality from polling-infrastructure (web-24) and navigation-state-management (web-26) zones into a coherent grouping. Address orphaned token-usage-nav.test.ts.
- Refactor web-16 main.ts god component to reduce cross-zone coupling
  Extract view registry pattern from main.ts to eliminate 13+ direct imports from web zone. Separate bootstrap concerns from view orchestration. Addresses web-16 coupling (0.8) and cohesion (0.2).
- Audit orphaned tests and standardize contract patterns
  Address two suggestions: audit test-implementation pairs for orphaned tests / incomplete features, and evaluate contract definition consistency across service zones.

- 🔶 **Address pattern issues (9 findings)** *(feature)*
  - Client-server architectural boundary is well-maintained except for schema-infrastructure zone violation
- Cross-cutting performance concerns are integrated into functional zones rather than separated into performance layers
- Domain boundary success varies dramatically: hench achieves clean layered isolation while web shows architectural sprawl across 29 zones
- Foundation anti-pattern where ui-foundation contains both infrastructure utilities and application-specific views
- Inconsistent service abstraction patterns across utility zones - some achieve clean boundaries while others leak implementation details to consumers
- Inconsistent use of abstraction patterns (hooks vs direct coupling) across similar UI zones indicates need for architectural standardization
- Zone size distribution shows healthy specialization pattern broken by one oversized catch-all zone that needs decomposition
- Critical architectural debt concentration in web package: 29 fragmented zones + god-zone pattern + systematic high coupling (12+ zones >0.6) indicates architectural reset needed before incremental improvements
- Missing abstraction layer pattern spans visualization (charts + navigation), UI foundation (scattered across zones), and service interfaces (inconsistent contract patterns), indicating systematic under-architecture rather than over-engineering
- 🔶 **Address suggestion issues (11 findings)** *(feature)*
  - Audit test-implementation pairs to identify orphaned tests and incomplete features that may indicate architectural boundary violations
- Consolidate scattered token usage functionality from polling-infrastructure and navigation-state-management into dedicated usage analytics zone
- Contract definition inconsistency across service zones - only command-validation uses explicit contracts.ts pattern
- Define architectural risk thresholds: zones with cohesion < 0.4 AND coupling > 0.6 should trigger mandatory refactoring
- Implement architectural risk scoring to identify zones with both low cohesion (<0.3) and high coupling (>0.7) for priority refactoring
- Prioritize refactoring zones with combined architectural risks: cohesion < 0.5 AND coupling > 0.6 indicate fragile components
- Three zones show catastrophic fragility (coupling >0.65, cohesion <0.4) requiring immediate architectural intervention before further development
- Decompose packages/web/src/viewer/views/prd.ts PRDView function (83 calls) into focused components: extract data fetching layer (estimated 20-25 calls), state management layer (estimated 15-20 calls), and presentation components (remaining calls)
- Establish architectural governance thresholds: zones with cohesion <0.4 AND coupling >0.6 require mandatory refactoring before new feature development - currently affects web-8, web-10, web-12, web-16 requiring immediate intervention
- Implement three-phase web package consolidation: Phase 1 - merge zones web-2,web-10,web-11,web-13 (shared coupling patterns), Phase 2 - consolidate visualization zones web-14,web-16,web-17,web-24, Phase 3 - extract shared UI foundation from primary web zone
- Refactor web-16 zone to reduce 13+ imports from web zone by extracting shared interface layer or moving components to appropriate architectural tier
- Address observation issues (26 findings) *(feature)*
  - 1 circular dependency chain detected — see imports.json for details
- Bidirectional coupling: "web" ↔ "web-18" (8+1 crossings) — consider extracting shared interface
- Four of five zones exceed healthy coupling thresholds (>0.6), suggesting systematic architecture review needed for UI component organization
- Multiple zones show architectural boundary issues, with only Error Recovery system achieving good cohesion/coupling balance
- 18 entry points — wide API surface, consider consolidating exports
- High coupling (0.65) — 2 imports target "web-2"

- High coupling (0.8) — 13 imports target "web"
- Low cohesion (0.2) — files are loosely related, consider splitting this zone
- High coupling (0.7) — 1 imports target "web-23"
- Low cohesion (0.3) — files are loosely related, consider splitting this zone
- High coupling (0.59) — 3 imports target "web-7"
- High coupling (0.51) — 1 imports target "web-28"
- High coupling (0.58) — 9 imports target "web-20"
- High coupling (0.71) — 1 imports target "web-23"
- High coupling (0.72) — 3 imports target "web"

- Low cohesion (0.38) — files are loosely related, consider splitting this zone
- Address relationship issues (2 findings) *(feature)*
  - Multi-level hub architecture with web-platform as primary hub and multiple secondary hubs creates complex dependency hierarchies
- Visualization concerns fragmented across multiple zones without clear abstraction hierarchy

  Each Rex view currently places primary actions (Add, Prune, Filter, Refresh) in different positions — some inline with section headers, some floating, some embedded mid-content. Define a single page-header action bar pattern and apply it consistently across Dashboard, PRD tree, proposals, and validation pages.
  - Tests cover codex and claude payload variants including missing fields
  - Aggregation tests verify per-tool, per-vendor/model, task, and project totals
  - Percentage tests verify correct outputs for normal, zero-budget, and missing-budget scenarios
  - All Rex views with primary actions use the same header action bar layout
  - Primary actions (Add, Filter, Refresh) appear in the top-right of their respective page header on every Rex view
  - Secondary/contextual actions (per-item operations) remain in context menus or inline controls, not in the page header
  - The action bar pattern is documented in a code comment or component prop contract for future contributors

**Rex Dashboard IA and LLM Utilization View**
- Promote Token Usage to a top-level Rex dashboard section
  Reorganize navigation and routing so token usage is directly visible under Rex without being nested in secondary views.
  - Rex sidebar/nav shows Token Usage as a parent-level section
  - Existing deep links route to the new location without broken navigation
  - Navigation tests confirm active-state behavior for the new section
- Build LLM utilization dashboard grouped by configured vendor/model
  Add a dashboard view that combines current project configuration and recent run usage to show totals, trends, and per-tool breakdowns.
  - View displays totals by vendor/model for the selected time range
  - View displays trend data across recent periods and per-tool (rex/hench/sourcevision) breakdown
  - Displayed usage source and time window are visible in the UI

**Task-Level Usage Visibility and Budget Context**
- 🔶 **Repair task token tag binding to accumulated usage totals**
  Fix task metadata mapping so each task reflects real summed usage from associated runs rather than stale or defaulted values.
  - Task list and task detail views show identical token totals for the same task
  - Totals update after new runs without manual data edits
  - Tasks with no associated usage render explicit zero state instead of blank
- Display task-level weekly budget percentage in task chips and details
  Show each task’s share of weekly budget using vendor/model-aware percentages so users can identify high-cost work quickly.
  - Each task with usage shows percentage of weekly budget next to token count
  - Percentage uses the budget that matches the task’s vendor/model usage source
  - When budget is missing, UI shows deterministic fallback label and no invalid percentage

**Token Usage Data Pipeline Recovery**
- 🔶 **Implement unified usage event normalization across Rex, Hench, and SourceVision logs**
  Create a shared normalization path that converts vendor-specific usage payloads into one canonical shape so downstream aggregation is consistent.
  - Usage records from rex, hench, and sourcevision are ingested into a single normalized structure
  - Normalized records include vendor, model, tool, timestamp, and token totals when present
  - Records missing optional fields are still accepted with explicit null/default values
- 🔶 **Fix Rex token aggregation queries that return zero for tasks and dashboard totals**
  Correct the aggregation logic and joins/lookups so token totals resolve from normalized usage events to task-level and project-level views.
  - At least one fixture run with non-zero usage produces non-zero task totals in Rex
  - Dashboard project totals match the sum of the same-period task totals
  - Regression test fails on prior zero-count behavior and passes with fix

**Vendor/Model Budget Configuration and Percentage Engine**
- Add weekly budget config keys scoped by vendor and model
  Extend config schema and defaults to store weekly token allotments per provider/model combination, with validation and clear error messages.
  - Config accepts budget entries keyed by vendor and model
  - Invalid budget values or malformed keys are rejected with actionable validation errors
  - CLI/config readout shows resolved weekly budgets for active project
- Implement weekly percentage calculator for task and project utilization
  Compute usage percentages against configured weekly budgets using a deterministic time window and expose the result to API/UI consumers.
  - Task utilization percentage is computed from task token total divided by matching vendor/model weekly budget
  - Project utilization percentage is computed from summed weekly usage against summed applicable budgets
  - Calculation tests cover boundary cases including zero budget, missing budget, and week rollover

- Token Usage Data Pipeline Recovery *(feature)*
  Restore end-to-end token accounting so Rex task and dashboard usage values reflect real run data instead of zeroed counters.
- Vendor/Model Budget Configuration and Percentage Engine *(feature)*
  Support configurable weekly token budgets by vendor/model and compute utilization percentages for tasks and project rollups.
- Rex Dashboard IA and LLM Utilization View *(feature)*
  Promote token usage to a first-class Rex section and add a dedicated vendor/model utilization dashboard.
- Task-Level Usage Visibility and Budget Context *(feature)*
  Expose accurate accumulated token usage on each task, including budget-relative context to support prioritization decisions.
- Diagnostics, Fallbacks, and Test Coverage *(feature)*
  Provide explicit diagnostics for missing usage metadata and add comprehensive tests for parsing and utilization math.

### Rex UI Consistency and Polish

**Broken and Non-Functional UI Element Repair**
- 🔶 **Audit all Rex page controls for broken interactivity and fix unresponsive elements**
  Systematically test every clickable and input element across Rex views. Non-functional controls erode user trust and make it unclear whether actions succeeded. Produce a fix list covering buttons that fire no handler, dropdowns that do not open, and status toggles that show no loading or confirmation state.
  - Every button and toggle in Rex views has an attached handler or is visibly disabled with a reason
  - Clicking any active control produces a visible response within 200ms (spinner, state change, or error message)
  - No interactive element is present in the DOM but invisible to click due to a z-index or pointer-events issue
  - Audit covers: Dashboard, PRD tree, task detail panel, smart add, prune, proposals, validation, and token usage views
- Fix broken layout containers and collapsed or zero-height sections
  Several Rex page sections render with zero height, invisible content areas, or collapsed containers that appear empty even when data is present. These are likely CSS flex/grid issues or missing height constraints on parent elements.
  - No Rex view section renders with zero height when it contains data
  - Scrollable content areas have explicit max-height or flex-grow constraints that prevent content from being clipped
  - Collapsible panels retain their last open/closed state across page navigation
  - Tested with both small (5 items) and large (100+ items) data sets

**Interactive Element Placement Standardization**
- Consolidate and reposition misplaced filter and sort controls in Rex PRD tree
  Filter controls (status filter, search, quick presets) are scattered at different vertical positions depending on which Rex sub-view is active. Consolidate them into a single persistent filter bar directly above the tree, visible on all Rex tree-based views.
  - Status filter, search input, and quick filter presets appear in a single bar directly above the PRD tree on all Rex tree views
  - Filter bar is sticky and remains visible when scrolling through a long tree
  - Filter state persists when switching between Rex sub-views (e.g., Dashboard → tree and back)
  - No filter controls appear below the tree or inside individual tree nodes
- Standardize per-item action menus and inline control placement across Rex tree nodes
  Task and epic nodes expose different controls in different positions — some show action buttons inline, some reveal them on hover, some have context menus that appear in unpredictable locations. Establish a single hover-reveal inline action pattern for all tree nodes.
  - All tree nodes (epic, feature, task, subtask) reveal the same set of contextual actions (Edit, Delete, Change status) on hover using a consistent icon-button row
  - Action buttons appear in the same position relative to the node label on every node type
  - No node type shows actions in a floating dropdown that covers adjacent rows
  - Keyboard navigation reaches inline node actions via Tab after the node label

**Typography and Text Rendering Fixes**
- Audit and fix font size and weight inconsistencies across Rex pages
  Walk every Rex view (Dashboard, PRD tree, task detail, proposals, validation, token usage) and produce a consistent type scale. Currently some labels render at unreadable sizes and headings vary arbitrarily between pages, making the UI feel unfinished.
  - All body text in Rex views uses a single consistent base size
  - Heading levels (h2/h3/h4) map to a documented type scale and do not vary between pages
  - No label or status badge text is smaller than 11px
  - Changes verified visually at 1280px and 1440px viewport widths
- Fix text overflow and truncation in task cards and detail panels
  Long task titles and descriptions currently overflow their containers or get clipped without ellipsis, and tooltip fallbacks are missing. This makes content unreadable without expanding items manually.
  - Task titles truncate with ellipsis at container boundary and show full text in a tooltip on hover
  - Description text in detail panels wraps correctly and does not overflow its scrollable region
  - Epic and feature titles in the PRD tree do not bleed outside their nodes
  - Behavior verified with titles of 30, 80, and 150 characters

**Visual and Spacing Consistency**
- Audit and normalize spacing and padding across all Rex page sections
  Rex pages currently mix arbitrary px values and inconsistent spacing tokens, making the layout feel cobbled together. Conduct a spacing audit and apply consistent margin/padding using the project's existing CSS custom properties or utility classes.
  - All Rex page sections use spacing values from a defined scale (e.g., 4px increments)
  - Card and panel components use uniform internal padding across all Rex views
  - Section separators and whitespace between stacked components are consistent within and across pages
  - No hard-coded px values for spacing remain outside of the design token definitions
- Align status badge and chip styles across Rex task and epic displays
  Status indicators (pending, in_progress, completed, failing, blocked) render with different sizes, colors, and border radii depending on where they appear. Centralize the badge/chip component and apply it uniformly across the PRD tree, task detail panel, and dashboard summary cards.
  - All status badges across Rex views use the same component with identical color, border-radius, and font-size
  - Priority chips (critical, high, medium, low) use a consistent color coding across the PRD tree, detail panel, and dashboard
  - Tag chips in task detail and tree nodes are visually identical
  - Changes do not regress any existing Vitest/component tests for badge or chip components

- Typography and Text Rendering Fixes *(feature)*
  Address small, broken, and inconsistently sized text across all Rex pages — including task cards, detail panels, status badges, and section headers
- Broken and Non-Functional UI Element Repair *(feature)*
  Identify and fix buttons, toggles, inputs, and other interactive controls across Rex pages that are visually present but non-functional, incorrectly wired, or produce no feedback
- Interactive Element Placement Standardization *(feature)*
  Rationalize the placement of action buttons, filters, and contextual controls across Rex pages — currently each page has invented its own layout for these, producing a disjointed experience
- Visual and Spacing Consistency *(feature)*
  Normalize spacing, padding, border, and color usage across all Rex views to eliminate the patchwork appearance caused by independently styled page sections

### Selective Recommendation Acceptance Syntax

**Indexed opt-in parsing for `recommend --accept`**
- 🔶 **Implement equals-prefixed index selector parsing for `recommend --accept`**
  Add command parsing support for values like `=1,4,5` so users can target specific recommendation indices without changing existing all-accept behavior.
  - Running `recommend --accept =1,4,5` parses indices as [1,4,5] when at least 5 recommendations exist
  - Parsing ignores surrounding whitespace in inputs like `=1, 4, 5`
  - Existing `recommend --accept` behavior without an equals selector remains unchanged
- 🔶 **Apply indexed selection to recommendation acceptance workflow**
  Wire parsed indices into the acceptance pipeline so only selected recommended items are accepted and persisted, preserving original recommendation ordering.
  - Only specified indices are accepted and written to PRD state
  - Unselected recommendations remain pending and are not mutated
  - Accepted items preserve the same relative order they had in the recommendation list

**Interactive parent-child inconsistency resolution**
- Add interactive prompts to rex validate for parent-child inconsistencies
  Update rex validate command to detect epicless features and present interactive resolution options, allowing users to choose between correlation recovery and safe deletion workflows
  - Detects features positioned at root level without parent epics during validation
  - Presents interactive prompt with correlation and deletion options
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing non-interactive validation behavior
  - Handles user cancellation and invalid input gracefully
- Implement epic correlation recovery for orphaned features
  Build recovery workflow that analyzes epicless features and suggests appropriate parent epics based on content analysis and existing PRD structure, enabling automated reparenting with user approval
  - Analyzes feature content and suggests semantically similar parent epics
  - Ranks suggestions based on content similarity and structural fit
  - Successfully reparents features while preserving all metadata and relationships
  - Provides fallback options when no suitable parent epic is found
- Add integrity-protected deletion option for epicless features
  Implement safe deletion workflow for epicless features with comprehensive dependency checks and corruption prevention safeguards, ensuring PRD structural integrity is maintained
  - Validates no dependent tasks or external references before deletion
  - Checks adapter sync states and prevents deletion if external corruption risk exists
  - Requires explicit user confirmation with clear consequence warnings
  - Maintains all PRD relationships and referential integrity after deletion

**Validation and UX messaging for selector input**
- Validate selector format and index bounds before applying acceptance
  Reject invalid selectors early to prevent unintended acceptance and ensure users receive deterministic errors for malformed syntax or unavailable indices.
  - Inputs without `=` when selector mode is expected return a format error with an example
  - Out-of-range indices (for example selecting 9 when only 8 exist) return a clear validation error
  - Duplicate indices are de-duplicated before execution or explicitly rejected with a consistent rule
- Add tests and help text for `=index` acceptance syntax
  Document the new selector option and cover it with automated tests so behavior remains stable across future CLI and workflow changes.
  - CLI help for `recommend --accept` includes an example using `=1,4,5`
  - Unit tests cover valid parsing, invalid syntax, out-of-range values, and mixed whitespace
  - Integration test verifies that selecting specific indices accepts only those recommendation items

- Indexed opt-in parsing for `recommend --accept` *(feature)*
  Allow users to accept only specific recommended items by providing an equals-prefixed index list (for example `=1,4,5`) instead of accepting all recommendations.
- Validation and UX messaging for selector input *(feature)*
  Provide clear guardrails and user feedback for malformed or out-of-range index selectors so partial acceptance is safe and predictable.
- Interactive parent-child inconsistency resolution *(feature)*
  Enhance existing rex validate and fix commands to detect parent-child structural inconsistencies and provide interactive resolution workflows for user-guided corrections

### SourceVision PR Markdown Artifact-Based Fallback Mode

**Fallback Output Semantics and Metadata**
- Render explicit fallback-mode labeling in generated PR markdown
  Prevent reviewer confusion by clearly marking markdown generated without git diff data and documenting the substitute evidence sources used.
  - Generated markdown includes a visible fallback mode label in the overview section
  - Markdown lists the evidence sources used (Rex, Hench) when present
  - Primary non-fallback markdown template remains unchanged when git diff succeeds
- Compute fallback confidence and coverage metrics from available evidence
  Quantify how complete and reliable the fallback summary is so reviewers can judge risk when git data is unavailable.
  - Coverage metric reports percentage of expected evidence sources found among configured fallback inputs
  - Confidence score decreases when required inputs are missing and increases when both Rex and Hench evidence are present
  - Metric outputs are deterministic for identical input artifacts
- Expose fallback metadata in refresh API and cached artifact payload
  Persist and return mode, confidence, and coverage fields so UI and downstream automation can distinguish fallback outputs programmatically.
  - Refresh API response includes mode, confidence, and coverage fields when fallback is used
  - Cached PR markdown artifact stores the same fallback metadata fields alongside content
  - Non-fallback responses explicitly report normal mode and do not include stale fallback metadata

**Fallback Trigger and Quality Regression Coverage**
- 🔶 **Add unit tests for fallback trigger classification across git failure modes**
  Protect routing logic by verifying that only intended preflight/fetch/diff failures activate fallback generation.
  - Tests cover at least preflight failure, fetch failure, and diff failure trigger paths
  - Tests assert non-git internal errors do not silently switch to fallback
  - All trigger classification tests pass in CI without network dependencies
- Add integration tests for fallback markdown labeling and metadata fields
  Validate end-to-end behavior so generated fallback markdown and API payloads remain reviewer-safe and machine-consumable.
  - Integration test asserts fallback markdown includes explicit mode label when diff generation is forced to fail
  - Integration test asserts API payload includes confidence and coverage metadata with valid numeric ranges
  - Integration test asserts successful git-diff path does not show fallback label

**Fallback Triggering and Orchestration**
- 🔶 **Implement git-failure fallback routing in PR markdown refresh pipeline**
  Route refresh execution to a fallback generator whenever preflight, fetch, or diff stages fail so the endpoint returns usable PR content instead of only an error state.
  - Given a simulated fetch failure, refresh returns HTTP success with fallback payload instead of aborting generation
  - Given a simulated diff-stage failure, refresh returns fallback payload and does not clear previously cached successful markdown
  - Fallback routing is only activated for classified git/preflight/diff failures and not for unrelated internal exceptions
- Extract branch-relevant completed Rex work items for fallback summaries
  Build a resolver that gathers completed epics/tasks associated with the active branch context so fallback output reflects actual delivered work.
  - Resolver returns completed Rex items scoped to the current branch context when mappings exist
  - Resolver excludes non-completed items from fallback summary inputs
  - When no branch-scoped Rex items are found, resolver returns an explicit empty-result signal consumed by fallback metadata
- Ingest Hench run artifacts into fallback summary input model
  Incorporate recent run artifacts as secondary evidence so fallback summaries include execution context when git diff evidence is unavailable.
  - Fallback input model includes Hench run identifiers and task associations when artifacts are present
  - Artifact parser tolerates missing or partial run fields without throwing
  - Fallback generator omits Hench section cleanly when no valid artifacts are available

- Fallback Triggering and Orchestration *(feature)*
  Ensure PR markdown generation still succeeds when git-based fetch or diff operations fail by switching to a deterministic artifact-based fallback path.
- Fallback Output Semantics and Metadata *(feature)*
  Make fallback output explicit, reviewable, and trustworthy by labeling mode and attaching measurable coverage and confidence signals.
- Fallback Trigger and Quality Regression Coverage *(feature)*
  Add automated tests validating fallback activation, output structure, and metadata correctness across key failure modes.

### SourceVision PR Markdown Git Preflight and Credential Diagnostics

**Pre-refresh Git Environment Validation**
- 🔶 **Implement repository state preflight before PR markdown refresh**
  Add a preflight step that verifies the working directory is a git repository and the current HEAD is attached to a branch before any diff or fetch operation runs.
  - Refresh flow runs repository-state preflight before invoking diff generation
  - When executed outside a git repository, response returns error code `NOT_A_REPO` and does not attempt diff/fetch
  - When HEAD is detached, response returns error code `DETACHED_HEAD` and includes current commit SHA in diagnostics
  - Unit tests cover success and both failure paths
- 🔶 **Add remote reachability and credential preflight checks**
  Proactively test remote connectivity and authentication so fetch-related issues are classified before refresh attempts fail with generic git errors.
  - Preflight performs a lightweight remote check against the configured base remote
  - Credential failures are classified as `FETCH_DENIED` when remote reports authorization/authentication rejection
  - Connectivity failures are classified as `NETWORK_DNS_ERROR` when DNS or transport connection fails
  - Refresh aborts before diff generation when remote or credential preflight fails
  - Tests cover auth-denied and network/DNS failure classification
- Validate base reference existence and shallow-clone readiness
  Ensure the configured base reference can be resolved locally and handle shallow history limitations before attempting branch comparison.
  - Preflight checks whether configured base ref resolves to a valid commit
  - If base ref is missing, response returns `MISSING_BASE_REF` with the unresolved ref name
  - If repository is shallow and lacks required history, response returns `SHALLOW_CLONE`
  - Integration tests simulate missing base ref and shallow clone scenarios with deterministic outcomes

**Targeted Remediation Contract for Preflight Failures**
- Define structured preflight error schema with remediation commands
  Extend refresh diagnostics contract to include stable failure codes, human-readable cause summaries, and command-ready remediation steps for each classified preflight error.
  - API response includes fields for `code`, `summary`, and `remediationCommands` on preflight failure
  - Each failure code in scope (`NOT_A_REPO`, `MISSING_BASE_REF`, `FETCH_DENIED`, `NETWORK_DNS_ERROR`, `DETACHED_HEAD`, `SHALLOW_CLONE`) maps to at least one remediation command
  - Schema validation fails when a preflight error is returned without remediation commands
  - Contract tests verify response shape for all scoped failure codes
- Replace generic PR markdown refresh git errors with classified preflight output
  Update refresh endpoint and PR Markdown UI messaging to prefer classified preflight diagnostics and hide low-signal raw git diff failure text.
  - When preflight fails, endpoint returns classified diagnostics and skips generic diff error wrapping
  - UI renders failure-specific remediation commands and does not display raw git stderr by default
  - Existing degraded-mode refresh behavior remains unchanged for non-preflight failures
  - Integration tests confirm targeted messaging appears for auth, network, and detached-head cases

- Pre-refresh Git Environment Validation *(feature)*
  Validate git prerequisites before PR markdown generation so refresh failures are detected early and reported with precise root causes.
- Targeted Remediation Contract for Preflight Failures *(feature)*
  Return actionable, error-specific remediation guidance so operators can recover quickly without inspecting raw git errors.

### SourceVision PR Markdown Quality & Manual Refresh

**Human-scoped PR Markdown Output**
- 🔶 **Redesign PR markdown template around scope, notable changes, and shoutouts**
  Establish a new output structure that leads with concise scope-of-work and key highlights so reviewers can understand intent quickly.
  - Generated markdown includes dedicated sections for Scope of Work, Notable Changes, and Shoutouts
  - Section order is consistent across runs
  - Template rendering succeeds when one or more sections have no items by showing an explicit fallback line
- 🔶 **Remove exhaustive per-file change tables from generated markdown**
  Reduce cognitive load by deleting detailed per-file tabular output and replacing it with concise grouped summaries.
  - Generated markdown contains no per-file change table blocks
  - Summary content is grouped by meaningful themes or workstreams instead of file paths
  - Regression test verifies old file-table markers are absent in output
- Add output quality guardrails for concise section length
  Prevent verbose output by enforcing practical limits and fallback behavior when generated sections become too long.
  - Each top-level summary section enforces a maximum item count or length limit
  - When truncation occurs, markdown includes an explicit note indicating truncation
  - Unit tests cover normal, empty, and over-limit section scenarios

**Manual Refresh-Only Generation Flow**
- 🔶 **Add SourceVision CLI command to refresh PR markdown on demand**
  Provide an explicit command entry point so users can regenerate PR markdown only when they choose.
  - New CLI command is available under SourceVision to refresh/regenerate PR markdown
  - Command exits with code 0 on success and non-zero on generation failure
  - Help output documents command purpose, usage, and expected output location
- 🔶 **Persist generated PR markdown and refresh metadata as cached artifact**
  Store generated content and metadata (including refresh timestamp and error state) so the UI can display stable results without recomputing.
  - Successful refresh writes markdown content and last-refreshed timestamp to cache
  - Failed refresh records an error state without deleting last successful content
  - Cache read path returns both content and metadata in a single model
- 🔶 **Remove automatic PR markdown refresh triggers from file and git change watchers**
  Eliminate background regeneration to make freshness explicit and predictable for users.
  - No automatic PR markdown regeneration occurs on file changes
  - No automatic PR markdown regeneration occurs on git diff changes
  - Integration test confirms output remains unchanged until a manual refresh action is invoked

**PR Tab Cached Display and Refresh UX**
- Render cached PR markdown content with last-refreshed timestamp in PR tab
  Ensure the tab shows the most recent generated artifact and metadata so users can trust what they are viewing.
  - PR tab loads cached markdown without triggering generation
  - UI displays a visible Last Refreshed timestamp from cache metadata
  - Timestamp formatting is consistent across reloads and navigation
- Implement explicit Refresh button in PR tab wired to manual regeneration endpoint
  Allow users to regenerate output from within the tab without relying on automatic background updates.
  - Refresh button invokes regeneration endpoint only on user click
  - UI shows in-progress state while refresh is running and disables duplicate clicks
  - On success, markdown content and last-refreshed timestamp update immediately
- Add stale, not-yet-generated, and refresh-error state views in PR tab
  Provide clear remediation guidance when content is outdated, missing, or generation fails.
  - Not-yet-generated state appears when no cached artifact exists and includes clear next action
  - Stale state appears when cache is older than defined threshold and prompts manual refresh
  - Refresh-error state shows error message plus option to retry without losing last successful output

- Human-scoped PR Markdown Output *(feature)*
  Refocus generated PR summaries on reviewer-friendly signal instead of exhaustive file-by-file noise.
- Manual Refresh-Only Generation Flow *(feature)*
  Replace automatic refresh behavior with explicit user-triggered regeneration via CLI and UI actions.
- PR Tab Cached Display and Refresh UX *(feature)*
  Update the SourceVision PR tab to show cached output and clear state messaging around freshness and failures.

### SourceVision PR Markdown Refresh Degraded-Mode Hardening

**PR Markdown UI messaging and regression coverage**
- Render degraded refresh banners with diagnostic-specific messaging
  Update PR Markdown tab messaging to display targeted degraded-state notices based on diagnostic codes while preserving cached markdown visibility.
  - UI shows cached markdown content when refresh response status is degraded
  - UI displays diagnostic-specific message variants for all supported codes
  - UI does not show generic refresh failure copy for classified degraded responses
- Surface remediation hints in PR Markdown refresh error panel
  Expose server-provided remediation hints directly in the PR Markdown tab so users can take immediate recovery actions.
  - When degraded response includes remediation hints, UI renders them as a visible actionable list
  - Hints are hidden when refresh succeeds or no hints are provided
  - Hint rendering is deterministic and preserves server-provided order
- Add integration tests for degraded refresh API and UI parity
  Prevent regressions by validating refresh behavior, diagnostics, cache retention, and UI messaging across all targeted failure classes.
  - API integration tests cover each classified failure code with cached markdown present and assert non-500 degraded responses
  - API tests assert cached markdown payload retention for degraded responses
  - UI integration tests assert diagnostic-specific messaging and remediation hint rendering for degraded responses

**Refresh endpoint degraded response parity**
- 🔶 **Implement degraded refresh response contract with cache retention**
  Ensure refresh returns a non-500 structured payload when generation fails for known git/base-branch conditions and cached markdown exists, so users keep usable output instead of losing access.
  - When cached markdown exists and refresh encounters a classified git/base-branch failure, the endpoint responds with HTTP 200 and a `degraded` status instead of HTTP 500
  - Response includes cached markdown content and last-refreshed metadata without mutation
  - Unhandled/unknown errors still return HTTP 500 with existing error envelope
- 🔶 **Add refresh failure classifier for git and base-branch resolution errors**
  Classify refresh failures into explicit diagnostic codes so clients can provide precise remediation guidance and avoid generic server-error messaging.
  - Classifier emits distinct codes for `missing_git`, `not_repo`, `unresolved_main_or_origin_main`, `fetch_failed`, `rev_parse_failed`, and `diff_failed`
  - Each classified code is propagated in refresh response diagnostics when triggered
  - Classifier is reused by refresh flow logic rather than duplicating ad-hoc string checks
- Attach actionable remediation hints to degraded diagnostics
  Provide operator-ready next steps in refresh responses so users can recover from degraded mode without reading logs or source code.
  - Each diagnostic code includes at least one remediation hint tailored to that failure mode
  - Hints are present in degraded refresh responses and omitted from successful refresh responses
  - Hints for unresolved base branch explicitly reference checking `main` and `origin/main` availability

- Refresh endpoint degraded response parity *(feature)*
  Make `/api/sv/pr-markdown/refresh` behave consistently with read/state endpoints by returning structured degraded responses when refresh prerequisites fail but cached markdown is available.
- PR Markdown UI messaging and regression coverage *(feature)*
  Align UI behavior and tests with degraded refresh responses so users see clear, cause-specific messaging while cached markdown remains available.

### SourceVision PR Markdown Tab Parity Hardening

**Endpoint Integration and Diagnostic States**
- 🔶 **Integrate PR Markdown view with data and state endpoints under a unified refresh loop**
  Use `/api/sv/pr-markdown` for content and `/api/sv/pr-markdown/state` for availability, with coordinated refresh behavior so UI state and markdown output stay in sync.
  - View fetches markdown content from `/api/sv/pr-markdown` and availability metadata from `/api/sv/pr-markdown/state`
  - Auto-refresh updates both state and markdown without requiring manual reload
  - When state reports unavailable, markdown fetch is skipped or safely handled to avoid repeated error spam
- 🔶 **Render cause-specific empty and error states with remediation guidance**
  Provide explicit messages and fix steps for known unavailability causes so users can self-resolve setup issues quickly.
  - UI shows a distinct message for 'not a git repository' with a concrete remediation step
  - UI shows a distinct message for 'unresolved base branch' with a concrete remediation step
  - UI shows a distinct message for 'wrong server/port or endpoint unreachable' with a concrete remediation step
  - Fallback error state handles unknown failures without exposing raw stack traces
- Add integration tests for PR Markdown tab parity and unavailable-state messaging
  Lock in behavior with end-to-end coverage for tab selection parity, route wiring, endpoint-driven refresh, and user-facing diagnostics.
  - Test verifies PR Markdown appears as a SourceVision sidebar tab and can be selected like existing tabs
  - Test verifies direct hash navigation to PR Markdown selects the correct tab and view
  - Test verifies unavailable-state messages for git repo, base branch, and server/port scenarios
  - Test verifies refresh loop updates displayed content when endpoint responses change

**Navigation and Routing Parity**
- 🔶 **Register PR Markdown in the shared SourceVision tab configuration**
  Centralize PR Markdown in the same tab metadata structure used by Import Graph and Zones so sidebar rendering and view wiring are driven by one source of truth.
  - PR Markdown appears in the SourceVision sidebar using the same tab component path as Import Graph and Zones
  - Tab metadata for PR Markdown is defined in the shared SourceVision tab config rather than ad-hoc conditional rendering
  - Selecting PR Markdown from the sidebar opens the PR Markdown view without requiring additional manual URL edits
- 🔶 **Normalize PR Markdown hash route parsing and tab selection state**
  Align PR Markdown route/hash handling with existing SourceVision views to prevent mismatches between URL, selected tab, and rendered content.
  - Loading the PR Markdown hash directly selects the PR Markdown tab and renders the PR Markdown view
  - Browser back/forward navigation updates both selected tab state and rendered panel correctly for PR Markdown
  - Unknown or malformed PR Markdown hashes fall back to the default SourceVision view without crashing

- Navigation and Routing Parity *(feature)*
  Make PR Markdown behave identically to first-class SourceVision tabs so navigation, selection, and deep-link behavior are consistent.
- Endpoint Integration and Diagnostic States *(feature)*
  Ensure PR Markdown data and availability state come from the dedicated APIs with clear, actionable UI feedback for unavailable scenarios.

### SourceVision Semantic Diff Failure UX Hardening

**Actionable UI diagnostics and retry guidance**
- Render semantic-diff failure diagnostics in PR Markdown UI banner and details panel
  Show structured failure data in the PR Markdown tab while continuing to display stale cached output, so users can diagnose issues without losing context.
  - UI displays a degraded-state banner when API reports semantic-diff failure
  - Details panel shows failing git subcommand and stderr excerpt from API response
  - Cached markdown remains visible and copyable while diagnostics are displayed
  - UI displays semantic-stage-specific remediation guidance distinct from name-status failures.
  - UI shows fallback state that explicitly indicates cached PR markdown was preserved.
  - End-to-end test validates API diagnostics are rendered with failing subcommand details and stage-appropriate remediation text.
- Classify retry guidance for fetch failures versus local history failures
  Differentiate remediation paths so users receive relevant retry instructions depending on whether failure stems from remote fetch/credentials or local branch/history state.
  - Failure classifier maps known fetch-related stderr patterns to fetch retry guidance
  - Failure classifier maps local-history stderr patterns to local remediation guidance
  - UI and API both expose the resolved guidance category and command suggestions for each classification path

**Deterministic Semantic Diff Command Execution**
- 🔶 **Enforce deterministic non-interactive flags for semantic diff git invocations**
  Prevent local external diff drivers, textconv filters, or interactive paging from changing semantic diff behavior so refresh results stay consistent across environments.
  - Semantic diff extraction runs with `--no-ext-diff` and `--no-textconv` on every refresh path.
  - Semantic diff command execution is non-interactive and does not invoke a pager or prompt for input.
  - Integration test verifies identical semantic diff extraction behavior when local git config enables external diff/textconv.
- 🔶 **Split semantic diff and name-status diff execution into independently classified stages**
  Ensure a semantic diff failure does not get conflated with name-status collection so diagnostics and fallback decisions are accurate.
  - Semantic diff and name-status diff run as separate stage executions with distinct status fields.
  - A semantic diff failure with successful name-status diff returns a mixed-stage result instead of a single generic failure.

### Token Event Attribution Accuracy

**Event-metadata-driven utilization aggregation**
- 🔶 **Refactor utilization aggregation to group by event vendor/model**
  Change aggregation queries and reducers to use vendor/model stored on each event as the grouping key so historical and mixed-model usage is reported correctly.
  - Utilization totals are grouped by vendor+model from event records, not from current config
  - Changing project config after events are recorded does not alter historical utilization group assignment
  - Aggregated totals equal the sum of raw event token counts for each vendor/model group
- Implement fallback bucketing for incomplete event metadata
  Prevent data loss by routing events with missing attribution into explicit fallback buckets that remain visible in utilization outputs.
  - Events missing vendor and/or model are included in utilization under deterministic fallback labels
  - Fallback-labeled totals are surfaced in the same API/UI responses as normal vendor/model groups
  - No token events are dropped from totals due to missing metadata fields
- Add cross-package regression tests for attribution and grouping
  Create tests that simulate Rex, Hench, and SourceVision events with mixed vendors/models to verify end-to-end attribution and aggregation behavior.
  - Test fixtures include events from all three packages with at least two distinct vendor/model pairs
  - Assertions verify aggregation groups match event metadata and not current configured model
  - Assertions verify fallback bucket behavior for events with missing metadata
  - All new tests pass in CI test suites covering usage aggregation

**Per-event vendor/model metadata capture**
- 🔶 **Persist vendor/model on Rex token usage events**
  Update Rex usage event emission to attach vendor and model from the active request context so each event is self-describing and survives config changes.
  - Each newly written Rex token event includes non-empty vendor and model fields when provider metadata is available
  - If provider metadata is unavailable, Rex writes explicit fallback values (for example "unknown") instead of omitting fields
  - Existing Rex event schema validation passes with the new metadata fields present
- 🔶 **Persist vendor/model on Hench token usage events**
  Capture vendor/model at the moment Hench records run and task token usage so mixed-provider runs are attributed correctly per event.
  - New Hench token events include vendor and model fields derived from actual run execution metadata
  - Events produced by retries or multi-step runs preserve the vendor/model used for each individual event
  - Hench run summary generation continues to work without schema errors after metadata addition
- Persist vendor/model on SourceVision token usage events
  Add vendor/model attribution to SourceVision analysis token events so analysis usage is grouped by actual model invocation details.
  - SourceVision token events written during analyze flows include vendor and model fields
  - When model resolution falls back, SourceVision records the resolved fallback model in the event metadata
  - SourceVision token event parsing and display paths handle the new metadata without regression

- Per-event vendor/model metadata capture *(feature)*
  Ensure every token usage event records the actual LLM vendor and model used at execution time so later reporting is based on facts, not mutable config.
