## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **Address relationship issues (5 findings)**
  - Hench is the only execution-layer package importing from a domain package (rex via gateway); if rex's public API changes, hench's gateway is the single choke-point — this is good design, but the gateway has no explicit version-lock or compatibility test to catch breaking changes early.
- Cross-zone import direction 'dom → web-viewer' conflicts with documented leaf-node status; verify whether dom-performance-monitoring imports anything from web-viewer or whether the arrow direction in the import table denotes 'exports to'. If dom does import from web-viewer, this is a circular dependency that must be resolved.
- Orchestration layer's zero-coupling guarantee is enforced structurally but not contractually — CLI argument interfaces between cli.js and domain package CLIs are untyped; adding schema validation or contract tests would make the spawn boundary explicit.
- viewer-static-assets has zero import-graph coupling but carries hidden deployment coupling to web-dashboard via build manifest filenames; this contract is not enforced by TypeScript and breaks silently if build output names change.
- boundary-check.test.ts appears to test zone-boundary contracts rather than websocket internals; relocating it to an integration test zone would remove the external coupling that degrades this zone's cohesion score.
- **Address anti-pattern issues (13 findings)**
  - rex-gateway.ts in hench re-exports 8 functions from rex with no version-lock or compatibility smoke test; breaking changes to rex's public API will only surface at runtime inside an agent loop, making them expensive to diagnose — add a gateway compatibility test
- Call graph reports coupling=0 while cross-zone import table records 1 outgoing import to web-viewer — metric disagreement between analysis passes produces unreliable zone health scores and must be resolved before coupling data can be trusted for this zone.
- MCP HTTP transport (the recommended integration path) has no E2E test coverage; the suite tests CLI process boundaries but not the HTTP session lifecycle, leaving the primary MCP surface unvalidated at the process boundary level.
- No shared E2E fixture or helper module detected across 14 test files; duplicated process-spawn and environment setup logic increases maintenance burden and risks inconsistent test environments between files — extract common setup into a shared e2e-helpers module.
- architecture-policy.test.js encodes zone IDs and tier boundaries statically; zone renames or structural changes will not automatically invalidate the policy assertions, creating a category of silent false-passes — tie policy checks to the live zone graph output rather than hardcoded identifiers.
- CLI argument interfaces between orchestration scripts and domain package CLIs are untyped; any CLI signature change in rex, hench, or sourcevision is a silent breaking change with no compile-time or schema-level safety net — add contract tests or a shared CLI-args schema to make this boundary explicit
- usage-cleanup-scheduler.ts depends on web-viewer (the UI application layer) from within a background service zone — scheduler lifecycle should be driven by an interface or event emitter, not a direct import of the viewer module, to prevent initialization-order coupling in tests and production startup
- No shared design-token layer exists between viewer-static-assets and web-landing despite both being presentation zones in the same package; brand drift between landing page and viewer is undetectable at build time
- elapsed-time.ts and task-audit.ts are reusable UI components but are grouped with build scripts and package assets in the web-build-infrastructure zone — they should be moved to the web-viewer zone or a dedicated components zone to collocate them with their consumers and avoid accidental coupling to build tooling
- Absence of a dedicated test-support or shared-fixtures zone forces web-viewer tests to import from the low-cohesion web-unit zone (6 imports); introducing a scoped test-support module would break this dependency and allow web-unit to be dissolved or tightened
- 2 production files (websocket.ts, ws-health-tracker.ts) do not justify an independent zone boundary; absorbing them into web-dashboard would eliminate the structural noise introduced by the test-inflated coupling metric
- God function: cmdAnalyze in packages/rex/src/cli/commands/analyze.ts calls 44 unique functions — consider decomposing into smaller, focused functions
- God function: runConfig in config.js calls 36 unique functions — consider decomposing into smaller, focused functions
- **Add CLI argument contract tests**
  CLI argument interfaces between orchestration scripts and domain package CLIs are untyped. Add contract tests that verify CLI help output matches expected argument signatures, catching silent breaking changes.
  - Contract test validates rex, hench, sourcevision CLI signatures
  - Test breaks when CLI args change without updating contract
  - Covers at least the top-level commands
- **Address pattern issues (5 findings)**
  - crash-recovery has only 1 incoming call-graph edge despite 3 cross-zone import edges from web-viewer. The zone is consumed by a single caller at runtime, making it a de facto singleton utility. This strengthens the case for absorbing it into web-dashboard as an internal sub-module rather than maintaining a separate zone boundary.
- Generated artifact HENCH_CALLGRAPH_FINDINGS.md is committed but has no CI regeneration-and-diff guard; it can silently go stale after hench source changes
- A single gateway file (src/prd/rex-gateway.ts) is the only cross-zone coupling surface for 160 files; gateway API breakage has maximum blast radius within hench — no incremental migration path exists if the rex API changes.
- Orchestration-to-domain boundary is enforced at runtime only (subprocess spawning); a mismatched CLI argument or removed subcommand will produce a silent runtime failure with no compile-time safety net.
- Zone conflates web-package unit tests with monorepo-root contract scripts; splitting into separate zones aligned to their physical location would improve discoverability and ownership clarity

## Major Changes

- **Address suggestion issues (17 findings)** [critical]
  - Run intra-package call-graph analysis on hench to detect any emerging circular call patterns between its internal subdirectories (agent/, prd/, tools/) before they compound — the rex circular call pattern (239+100 calls) was only found via call-graph analysis, not zone metrics, and hench's 2838 internal calls make it the most likely next site for a hidden cycle.
- Add a dependency-cruiser or similar import-boundary rule to CI that enforces the gateway pattern: any cross-package import that does not pass through the designated gateway module should fail the build. This converts a trust-based convention into a machine-enforced constraint.
- All micro-zones (< 5 production files) in the web package lack facade index modules, meaning their zone boundaries exist only in the zone detection metadata and are invisible to the TypeScript compiler — mandate an 'index.ts' barrel for every zone with 2+ production files to make zone membership compiler-visible and reduce the risk of zone boundaries eroding silently.
- Establish a documented testing convention for the utility+hook pattern: every hook wrapper (use-*.ts) should have a corresponding hook test file alongside the utility test — currently dom-performance-monitoring applies the production pattern but not the test pattern, and without a written convention future hooks will follow the same incomplete template.
- Introduce a project-wide lint rule enforcing that files in 'src/server/' cannot import from 'src/viewer/' — the two known violations (task-usage-tracking, websocket boundary-check) both evade detection because the no-upward-import convention is undocumented and unenforced; a lint rule would surface new violations at PR time rather than zone-enrichment time.
- Reconcile the two analysis passes (call-graph and cross-zone import table) that report contradictory coupling values for the dom zone — add a CI step that asserts zone IDs are consistent across both passes and flags any zone that appears in one pass but not the other, before this class of metric disagreement spreads to other zones.
- 5 zones exceed architectural risk thresholds (cohesion < 0.4, coupling > 0.6): packages-rex:unit-core, packages-rex:unit-cli, websocket-infrastructure, packages-sourcevision:analyzers-3, packages-rex:unit — mandatory refactoring recommended before further development
- Split the web-build-infrastructure zone into two groups: (1) build tooling (build.js, dev.js, package.json, images, markdown) and (2) reusable UI components (elapsed-time.ts, task-audit.ts) — these two groups have different change drivers, different consumers, and different lifecycle concerns that should not share a zone boundary.
- Add use-dom-performance-monitor.test.ts to cover the hook's lifecycle: verify the monitor is started on mount, stopped on unmount, and that ref changes trigger re-subscription — the utility has test coverage but the hook wrapper that most consumers interact with does not.
- Document the execution log rotation policy (max file size, max file count, rotation trigger) in .rex/config.json or a companion README to prevent unbounded log accumulation and clarify when execution-log.1.jsonl vs execution-log.jsonl is the authoritative current log.
- Neither source file in this zone exports through a shared index — introduce a thin 'index.ts' barrel that re-exports the public surfaces of both services, giving the zone an explicit boundary and preventing consumers from coupling to internal file paths.
- websocket-infrastructure breaches both cohesion (<0.5) and coupling (>0.5) thresholds simultaneously — this double breach qualifies it as the highest-priority structural risk in the web package; dissolve the zone by absorbing websocket.ts and ws-health-tracker.ts into web-dashboard and relocating boundary-check.test.ts to the integration test suite.
- Zone "WebSocket Infrastructure" (websocket-infrastructure) has catastrophic risk (score: 0.75, cohesion: 0.25, coupling: 0.75) — requires immediate architectural intervention
- Zone "Unit Core" (packages-rex:unit-core) has catastrophic risk (score: 0.83, cohesion: 0.17, coupling: 0.83) — requires immediate architectural intervention
- Zone "Unit Cli" (packages-rex:unit-cli) has catastrophic risk (score: 0.75, cohesion: 0.25, coupling: 0.75) — requires immediate architectural intervention
- Zone "Analyzers 3" (packages-sourcevision:analyzers-3) has critical risk (score: 0.69, cohesion: 0.31, coupling: 0.69) — requires refactoring before new feature development
- Zone "Unit" (packages-rex:unit) has critical risk (score: 0.67, cohesion: 0.33, coupling: 0.67) — requires refactoring before new feature development
- **Address suggestion issues (9 findings)** [critical]
  - Add a pnpm verify script (or Makefile target) that runs all three verification-tier mechanisms in sequence: vitest e2e, check-gateway-regex.mjs, check-gateway-test.mjs, and test-zone-consistency.mjs — removes the current requirement for contributors to manually discover and run four separate commands
- Add an intra-package layer-direction check to architecture-policy.test.js that parses import paths within each package and asserts domain files do not import from cli/ subdirectories — directly guards the existing packages-rex circular sub-zone violation and prevents recurrence
- Create a single gateway-rules.json (or equivalent) at the monorepo root that both check-gateway-regex.mjs and architecture-policy.test.js consume as the authoritative source of gateway file paths and allowed import patterns — eliminates silent divergence between two enforcement mechanisms
- packages/hench/package-lock.json should not exist in a pnpm workspace. It can cause dependency resolution conflicts if npm is run inside the package. Verify it is not committed to source control or add it to .gitignore, and document that pnpm is the sole package manager for this monorepo.
- Add a dedicated intra-package layering test (e.g., in architecture-policy.test.js) that asserts domain-layer files do not import from CLI-layer files within the same package — this would catch the existing packages-rex:unit-analyze→cli violation and prevent recurrence
- Zone "Crash Recovery" (crash-recovery) has catastrophic risk (score: 0.71, cohesion: 0.29, coupling: 0.71) — requires immediate architectural intervention
- The fix for the useState misuse in analyze-panel.ts requires two coordinated edits: (1) add useEffect to the import on line 9: `import { useState, useCallback, useEffect } from 'preact/hooks'`, and (2) replace line 74 with `useEffect(() => { loadPending(); }, [])`. Both changes must land together — changing line 74 without updating the import will fail the TypeScript build.
- Add a self-test or snapshot fixture to check-gateway-regex.mjs and check-gateway-test.mjs that validates the regex patterns catch known-bad imports — untested validators provide false confidence
- Bind the gateway check scripts to gateway file paths via a shared config constant rather than hardcoded regex strings, so renaming a gateway file breaks the check explicitly rather than silently
- **Repository Governance and Community Standards**
- **Address suggestion issues (1 findings)** [critical]
  - Zone "Crash Recovery" (crash-recovery) has catastrophic risk (score: 0.71, cohesion: 0.29, coupling: 0.71) — requires immediate architectural intervention
- **Address suggestion issues (3 findings)** [critical]
  - Move check-gateway-regex.mjs and check-gateway-test.mjs to the top-level scripts/ directory (which already exists as its own zone). This single change resolves three compounding issues simultaneously: it eliminates the cohesion-1 metric artifact in web-landing (finding 4), removes the gateway-filename namespace collision flagged in finding 6, and correctly co-locates the files with other governance/CI scripts where they semantically belong. No rename is required if the files are relocated to scripts/ — the naming ambiguity only exists because they share a directory with production landing assets.
- Set the archetype of landing.ts to [entrypoint] in sourcevision metadata. Findings 3 and 5 independently identify the same misclassification: a file that bootstraps the landing page is currently typed as [service], which excludes it from entrypoint-based dead-code detection and bundle entry audits. The fix is a one-line archetype override — no code change required.
- Zone "Web Unit" (web-unit) has catastrophic risk (score: 0.71, cohesion: 0.29, coupling: 0.71) — requires immediate architectural intervention

### (Ungrouped)

**Address anti-pattern issues (13 findings)**
- ⚠️ **Add CLI argument contract tests**
  CLI argument interfaces between orchestration scripts and domain package CLIs are untyped. Add contract tests that verify CLI help output matches expected argument signatures, catching silent breaking changes.
  - Contract test validates rex, hench, sourcevision CLI signatures
  - Test breaks when CLI args change without updating contract
  - Covers at least the top-level commands
- Add gateway compatibility test for hench rex-gateway
  rex-gateway.ts in hench re-exports 8+ functions from rex with no version-lock or compatibility smoke test. Add a test that verifies all re-exported functions exist and are callable, so rex API changes are caught at test time rather than at runtime inside agent loops.
  - Gateway compatibility test exists in hench test suite
  - Test verifies all re-exported functions are defined and callable
  - Test fails if any re-exported function is removed from rex public API
- Extract shared E2E test helpers module
  No shared E2E fixture or helper module across 14 test files. Extract common process-spawn, environment setup, and cleanup logic into a shared e2e-helpers module to reduce duplication and ensure consistent test environments.
  - Shared e2e-helpers module exists in tests/e2e/
  - Common spawn/setup patterns extracted from existing tests
  - At least 3 existing test files updated to use shared helpers
- Decompose cmdAnalyze god function
  cmdAnalyze in packages/rex/src/cli/commands/analyze.ts calls 44 unique functions. Decompose into smaller, focused phases (config resolution, scanning, proposal processing, acceptance).
  - cmdAnalyze broken into named sub-functions
  - Each extracted function has a clear single responsibility
  - Existing tests continue to pass
- Decompose runConfig god function
  runConfig in config.js calls 36 unique functions. Decompose into smaller, focused functions for each config section handler.
  - runConfig broken into named sub-functions
  - Each section handler is its own function
  - Existing tests continue to pass
- Fix usage-cleanup-scheduler web-viewer coupling
- Move elapsed-time.ts and task-audit.ts to viewer zone
- Absorb websocket zone into web-dashboard
- Tie architecture policy test to live zone graph

**Address observation issues (10 findings)**
- Pin crash-recovery and web-package-scaffold UI files to correct zones
  Add zone pins in .n-dx.json for: crash-detector.ts, use-crash-recovery.ts, crash-recovery-banner.ts, crash-detector-test-support.ts, crash-detector.test.ts → web-dashboard; route-state.ts, use-tick.ts, lazy-children.ts, listener-lifecycle.ts → web-dashboard. This resolves findings 1-3, 5, 8, 10.
- Add unit test for use-crash-recovery.ts hook
  Write unit tests for the useCrashRecovery Preact hook covering: initial detection, state saving on view changes, dismiss/restore actions, disabled mode, and crash loop detection. Finding 4.
- Add unit tests for analyze-panel.ts and proposal-editor.ts
  Write unit tests for the two complex PRD analysis UI components. Finding 9.
- Document fan-in hotspot and review web-dashboard entry points

**Address relationship issues (5 findings)**
- Verify dom→web-viewer cross-zone import direction is not circular
  Finding #2: Cross-zone import direction 'dom → web-viewer' conflicts with documented leaf-node status. Verify the import direction and document/resolve.
- Add CLI spawn boundary contract tests
  Finding #3: Orchestration layer's zero-coupling guarantee is enforced structurally but not contractually. Add contract tests that verify each domain CLI accepts the expected arguments and returns expected exit codes.
- Add viewer build output contract assertion
  Finding #4: viewer-static-assets has hidden deployment coupling to web-dashboard via build manifest filenames. Add a contract test that verifies expected build outputs exist after build.
- Relocate boundary-check.test.ts to integration tests

**Address suggestion issues (17 findings)**
- Add gateway pattern import boundary enforcement to CI
  Add an eslint rule or custom CI check that enforces the gateway pattern: any cross-package runtime import that does not pass through the designated gateway module should fail the build. Also add a rule preventing src/server/ from importing src/viewer/ in the web package. Covers findings: gateway pattern CI enforcement, server/viewer import boundary.
  - CI step validates that cross-package imports only go through gateway modules
  - ESLint or custom rule prevents packages/web/src/server/ from importing packages/web/src/viewer/
  - Existing code passes the new rules (no false positives)
- Add use-dom-performance-monitor hook test and document utility+hook testing convention
  Write use-dom-performance-monitor.test.ts covering hook lifecycle: monitor started on mount, stopped on unmount, ref changes trigger re-subscription. Document the testing convention for utility+hook pattern in PACKAGE_GUIDELINES.md.
  - use-dom-performance-monitor.test.ts exists with mount/unmount/ref-change tests
  - PACKAGE_GUIDELINES.md documents the utility+hook testing convention
  - Tests pass in CI
- Address high-risk zone metrics (5 zones exceeding thresholds)
  Address the 5 zones exceeding architectural risk thresholds: packages-rex:unit-core (0.83 risk), packages-rex:unit-cli (0.75 risk), websocket-infrastructure (0.75 risk), packages-sourcevision:analyzers-3 (0.69 risk), packages-rex:unit (0.67 risk). Dissolve websocket-infrastructure by absorbing into web-dashboard. Split web-build-infrastructure into build tooling and UI components. Investigate and refactor rex zones for better cohesion/coupling.
  - websocket-infrastructure zone dissolved into web-dashboard
  - web-build-infrastructure split into build tooling and UI components
  - All 5 high-risk zones show improved metrics or have documented justification for current structure
- Add barrel index.ts for web micro-zones and dom-performance-monitoring zone
- Document execution log rotation policy
- Hench call-graph analysis and analysis pass reconciliation

- Address observation issues (8 findings) *(feature)*
  - Bidirectional coupling: "task-usage-tracking" ↔ "web-dashboard" (1+3 crossings) — consider extracting shared interface
- Bidirectional coupling: "web-build-infrastructure" ↔ "web-dashboard" (4+2 crossings) — consider extracting shared interface
- Fan-in hotspot: packages/rex/src/schema/index.ts receives calls from 22 files — high-impact module, changes may have wide ripple effects
- Low cohesion (0.25) — files are loosely related, consider splitting this zone
- Cohesion of 0.25 and coupling of 0.75 indicate significant structural fragmentation — likely caused by test files importing broadly from the rest of the web package.
- Only 2 of 6 files are production source; the test-to-source ratio inflates coupling scores and suggests the zone boundary is defined by test co-location rather than domain cohesion.
- The cleanup scheduler imports back into web-viewer (per cross-zone import graph), creating a dependency inversion — the scheduler should depend on an interface, not the viewer zone.
- Bidirectional imports between web and web-viewer (web→web-viewer: 4, web-viewer→web: 2) create a soft cycle risk; extracting shared primitives into a dedicated shared zone would eliminate this.
- Address pattern issues (4 findings) *(feature)*
  - E2E suite has zero source-level coupling but a hidden build-time dependency on all packages; CI must enforce a build step before e2e execution. This should be documented or enforced via a pre-test script to prevent silent false-negatives when a package fails to compile.
- The runtime-state zone is a shared mutable sink readable by both rex and hench packages without creating import-graph coupling — this is an intentional design but concurrent write safety is implicit; documenting the write-access protocol would prevent future race conditions.
- Absence of an index/facade module means task-usage-tracking has no encapsulated public surface; consumers couple directly to internal service files, weakening the zone boundary.
- Build scripts (build.js, dev.js) in this zone operate at the package boundary but are grouped with UI components (elapsed-time.ts, task-audit.ts) — splitting into a pure build-config group and a reusable-components group would clarify which files are tooling versus production API surface.
- Address observation issues (10 findings) *(feature)*
  - High coupling (0.71) — 3 imports target "web-dashboard"
- Cohesion of 0.29 is below the warning threshold — the two files in this zone (hook and detector) are more coupled to web-dashboard than to each other, suggesting a zone boundary mismatch.
- Coupling of 0.71 exceeds the warning threshold; the crash recovery subsystem has high external dependency, which reduces its reusability and increases change risk.
- use-crash-recovery.ts lacks a unit test; given that crash recovery is a reliability-critical code path, this gap should be addressed.
- Bidirectional coupling: "web-dashboard" ↔ "web-package-scaffold" (3+9 crossings) — consider extracting shared interface
- Fan-in hotspot: packages/rex/src/schema/index.ts receives calls from 22 files — high-impact module, changes may have wide ripple effects
- 9 entry points — wide API surface, consider consolidating exports
- Bidirectional imports with both 'crash' and 'panel' zones create implicit circular dependencies at the zone level; these relationships should be reviewed to ensure directional ownership is clear.
- analyze-panel.ts and proposal-editor.ts lack unit tests while the simpler smart-add-input and batch-import-panel components are tested — the more complex components should be prioritized for test coverage.
- Viewer UI files are co-classified with build scripts due to shared import edges; zone pinning for elapsed-time.ts, route-state.ts, task-audit.ts, use-tick.ts, lazy-children.ts, and listener-lifecycle.ts is recommended to correct classification.
- Address anti-pattern issues (11 findings) *(feature)*
  - E2E tests that spawn CLI subprocesses share no documented workspace isolation strategy; if tests run concurrently and both write to .rex/prd.json or .sourcevision/, results are non-deterministic. No test uses a dedicated temp directory per test file.
- `_testHelpers` is exported through the production module surface of crash-detector.ts, bundling internal implementation details (storage keys, private functions) into the public API. Test-only exports should use a separate test-support file or conditional barrel to avoid polluting the production interface.
- hench-callgraph-analysis.mjs produces HENCH_CALLGRAPH_FINDINGS.md but has no fail-fast guard that detects missing or stale input artifacts; silent success on a cold checkout produces a misleading (empty or stale) report with no error signal.
- The rex-gateway is imported directly by scattered consumer files across 160 files with no internal hench interface layer. When the rex gateway API changes, every call site must be updated individually with no intermediate abstraction to narrow the scope of change. An internal adapter or facade within hench that wraps the gateway would contain the blast radius.
- The orchestration tier's architectural boundary (no direct package imports) is enforced solely by developer convention — no ESLint rule, TypeScript path mapping, or CI check prevents a direct `import` from cli.js into a domain package. A single accidental import would collapse the tier silently.
- claude-integration.js is a service file at the monorepo root that bypasses the gateway pattern entirely. Any cross-package imports it makes are invisible to gateway audits and import-graph coupling scores, creating an unmonitored coupling surface outside all four tiers of the dependency hierarchy.
- Proposal, ProposalFeature, and ProposalTask types are defined locally in analyze-panel.ts rather than imported from a shared rex schema or gateway. The local copy will silently diverge from the API response shape if the server-side PRD proposal format changes.
- `useState(() => { loadPending(); })` in analyze-panel.ts misuses the useState initializer to trigger an async network call. This is not the intended use of the initializer (which sets initial synchronous state) and bypasses the standard effect lifecycle, making cleanup and double-invocation behavior undefined.
- Web viewer unit tests (graph-interaction.test.ts, graph-zoom.test.ts) are excluded from packages/web per-package test coverage because they reside outside the package boundary in this zone; per-package coverage reports for the web package silently undercount viewer UI test coverage.
- Zone contains files from two physically distinct roots (packages/web/tests/unit/viewer/ and tests/) with unrelated purposes; zone name 'viewer-gateway-tests' implies viewer scope only, actively misleading contributors about the gateway scripts' monorepo-wide scope. Should be split into two zones aligned to physical location and concern.
- God function: <module> in packages/web/src/landing/landing.ts calls 42 unique functions — consider decomposing into smaller, focused functions
- Address observation issues (8 findings) *(feature)*
  - cli-contract.test.mjs living alongside non-test .mjs scripts rather than in tests/e2e/ may cause it to be excluded from standard test runner discovery if glob patterns only target tests/e2e/.
- Bidirectional coupling: "web-build-tooling" ↔ "web-dashboard" (10+4 crossings) — consider extracting shared interface
- Fan-in hotspot: packages/rex/src/schema/index.ts receives calls from 22 files — high-impact module, changes may have wide ripple effects
- High coupling (0.56) — 1 imports target "web-dashboard"
- Cohesion of 0.44 is below the recommended 0.5 threshold; the three components (smart-add-input, proposal-editor, batch-import-panel) may have been grouped algorithmically by shared test imports rather than by meaningful domain affinity.
- Coupling of 0.56 approaches the high-coupling threshold; auditing which viewer internals these components import could reveal opportunities to depend on stable public APIs instead.
- Bidirectional import coupling between web and web-viewer (10 web→web-viewer, 4 web-viewer→web) is the primary cause of the 0.42 coupling score; the web-viewer→web direction should be audited to ensure viewer code is not importing build infrastructure.
- Cohesion of 0.58 is below the ideal threshold because viewer UI components (elapsed-time.ts, use-tick.ts, route-state.ts, task-audit.ts) are co-classified with build scripts — reclassifying them into web-viewer would restore cohesion for both zones.

  - God function: agentLoop in packages/hench/src/agent/lifecycle/loop.ts calls 38 unique functions — consider decomposing into smaller, focused functions
- Address observation issues (9 findings) *(feature)*
  - High coupling (0.71) — 3 imports target "web-dashboard"
- Low cohesion (0.29) — files are loosely related, consider splitting this zone
- The mutual three-import dependency between crash-recovery and web-dashboard creates a cycle at the zone level; restructure so crash-detector.ts is a pure utility imported by the viewer, with no reverse dependency from crash-recovery back into the dashboard.
- Zone cohesion of 0.29 and coupling of 0.71 indicates the crash-recovery files are more tightly connected to external zones than to each other; consider whether crash-detector.ts and use-crash-recovery.ts belong in separate zones (utility vs. hook) or should be merged into the web-dashboard zone they depend on.
- This zone conflates two unrelated concerns: web-viewer graph interaction tests and monorepo dev-analysis scripts. It is an algorithmic artifact, not a real architectural unit.
- Bidirectional coupling: "web-build-tooling" ↔ "web-dashboard" (9+3 crossings) — consider extracting shared interface
- Fan-in hotspot: packages/rex/src/schema/index.ts receives calls from 22 files — high-impact module, changes may have wide ripple effects
- tests/check-gateway-regex.mjs and tests/check-gateway-test.mjs are developer-utility scripts unrelated to the landing page; they should be re-homed to the developer-utilities zone to keep this zone semantically coherent.
- Five viewer UI files (elapsed-time.ts, use-tick.ts, lazy-children.ts, listener-lifecycle.ts, task-audit.ts) are grouped with build infrastructure by the import graph but belong architecturally in the web-viewer zone per developer hints — setting explicit zone pins for these files would correct the misclassification.

- Address pattern issues (1 findings) *(feature)*
  - Perfectly isolated files (no imports in or out) always achieve cohesion: 1 by definition regardless of semantic relatedness. web-landing's perfect cohesion score is a metric artifact caused by the two governance scripts, not evidence of a genuinely cohesive zone.
