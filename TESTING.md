# Testing Conventions

## Test Directory Structure

Every package must maintain three test tiers:

```
packages/<name>/tests/
  unit/           # Isolated function/class tests (no I/O, no network)
  integration/    # In-process contract tests (real stores, gateways, pipelines)
  e2e/            # Full CLI/process tests (spawn commands, validate output)
  fixtures/       # Shared test data
```

## Integration Test Tier

The integration tier bridges the gap between unit tests (isolated) and e2e tests
(full CLI spawn). Each package must have a `tests/integration/` directory with
tests that exercise in-process contract scenarios.

### Required Coverage

| Package | Required integration scenarios |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| rex | Store mutation correctness, tree traversal pipeline, task selection with real PRDStore |
| sourcevision | Analyzer pipeline phases in-process, zone detection with real file inventory |
| hench | Gateway re-export validation, agent loop with mocked LLM responses |
| web | Cross-zone boundary checks, gateway re-export validation, messaging pipeline integration |
| llm-client | Adapter resolution, config loading with real filesystem |

### Gateway Admission Criterion

Any new gateway module (rex-gateway, domain-gateway, llm-gateway, external.ts)
**must** have a corresponding integration test added to `tests/integration/`
within the same PR that introduces the gateway. This prevents gateways from
existing with zero integration-tier coverage.

Integration tests for gateways should verify:

1. **Re-export existence** -- every symbol re-exported by the gateway is
   callable/constructible (catches API drift from upstream)
2. **Contract correctness** -- at least one end-to-end scenario through the
   gateway (e.g., `resolveStore()` -> `findNextTask()` -> `updateStatus()`)
3. **Type alignment** -- type re-exports match the upstream package's public API

### Test File Placement Convention

A test file whose primary production import target is classified in zone X must
reside under a directory corresponding to X, not a sibling zone's directory.

Examples:
- Tests for `src/shared/node-culler.ts` belong in `tests/unit/shared/`, not `tests/unit/viewer/`
- Tests for `src/server/routes/` belong in `tests/unit/server/`, not `tests/unit/viewer/`
- Tests for `src/viewer/messaging/` belong in `tests/unit/viewer/` (messaging is a viewer sub-zone)

### Integration Test Growth Policy

The integration test count should grow proportionally with cross-package
boundaries. Target: at least one integration test file per architectural
boundary (hench<>rex, web<>rex, web<>sourcevision, viewer<>shared, server<>viewer).

Minimum ratio: integration test files >= 15% of e2e test file count.
This is enforced by `tests/e2e/integration-coverage-policy.test.js`.
