### Patch Changes

- [#298](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/298) [`1031719`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/1031719e295722833e2982c720e93ff56a929fad) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Detect authentication/session loss before it cascades. `@n-dx/llm-client` now exports `isAuthError(message)`, a shared predicate that recognizes both API auth failures (401/403, rejected/invalid keys, `unauthorized`) and CLI session loss (`not logged in`, `please run … login`, `/login`, expired/revoked sessions or OAuth tokens, `re-authenticate`). `classifyLLMError` uses it, so lost-session messages are now classified as `auth` with re-authentication guidance. In hench's CLI run-loop, `processErrorResult` checks for auth errors _before_ the transient-retry check: auth loss is never transient, so the run now fails immediately with actionable re-auth guidance (and a distinct `auth_error` log event) instead of burning retries on a failure the user must fix.

- [#317](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/317) [`68616e5`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/68616e550d0b062cee6add7e18df69a65164dd92) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Enforce the git-subcommand allowlist in CLI provider mode. Previously only the
  API-provider agent loop honored `guard.allowedGitSubcommands`; CLI-mode spawns
  were granted a blanket `Bash(git:*)`, which auto-approved destructive
  subcommands (`reset`, `clean`, `revert`, `push`). The Claude CLI adapter now
  grants `git` at subcommand granularity (`Bash(git commit:*)`, …) drawn from the
  guard allowlist, so destructive subcommands fall through to a permission prompt
  (denied under a non-interactive `acceptEdits` spawn). Codex remains
  sandbox-gated (no per-command allowlist). When no allowlist is present, `git`
  keeps its legacy unscoped grant.

The Codex CLI adapter previously passed the entire `SYSTEM:`/`TASK:` prompt (bounded at 400 KB) as the last `codex exec` argument, which exceeds the OS `ARG_MAX` for a single argv element and crashed real task briefs with `E2BIG` — a primary reason Codex runs were unusable. The adapter now appends `-` and writes the prompt to stdin, matching the Claude adapter and the `@n-dx/llm-client` Codex provider.

- [#298](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/298) [`1031719`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/1031719e295722833e2982c720e93ff56a929fad) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Make Codex quota/token reporting behave sanely under `codex login` (session auth). The quota path required `OPENAI_API_KEY` and matched usage by exact model id, which broke the primary Codex auth flow — session auth never sets an API key (the CLI provider even deletes it), so quota was silently skipped and token retrieval returned not-found for real accounts.

  - **Session-auth quota notice:** when Codex is the active vendor and no API key is present, `checkQuotaRemaining` now surfaces a clear `quota unavailable — codex login (session auth) — set OPENAI_API_KEY or llm.codex.api_key for quota` entry instead of silently emitting nothing. `QuotaRemaining` gains an optional `notice` field rendered by `formatQuotaLog`.
  - **Dated deployment ids:** Codex token retrieval now matches the OpenAI usage `model` field tolerantly (`modelMatches`/`stripModelDateSuffix`), so dated deployment ids such as `gpt-5-codex-2025-03-01` resolve to the configured base id `gpt-5-codex`. Matching uses equality after date-stripping, so prefix-sharing models (`gpt-4o` vs `gpt-4o-mini`) never collide.

- [#298](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/298) [`1031719`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/1031719e295722833e2982c720e93ff56a929fad) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Wire Codex text-format token accounting into the event-pipeline close path. When `config.useEventPipeline` was enabled, the two non-JSON `catch` blocks in `spawnWithAdapter`'s close handler were empty, unlike the legacy path which falls back to `parseCodexCliTokenUsage`. Because `codex --json` emits JSONL, `JSON.parse(fullStdout)` always throws, so enabling the event pipeline silently zeroed Codex token/credit accounting. Both catch blocks now recover token usage from the text-format summary line and push a `token_usage` event into the accumulator.

- [#316](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/316) [`c5fdbed`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/c5fdbed684ee91e1b6ceeb77b64bbb3f12b98600) Thanks [@stevemikedan](https://github.com/stevemikedan)! - fix(hench): commit task-completion metadata on the autoCommit path, and stop dropping `fullTestCommand` from config ([#302](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/issues/302))

  On the `autoCommit` path the agent commits its own code mid-run and `performCommitPromptIfNeeded` is a no-op, so the completion/resolution metadata written to `.rex/prd_tree` by `updateCompletedTaskStatus` was never committed — it orphaned in the working tree and tripped the next run's pre-run commit gate. `finalizeRun` now calls a focused `commitCompletionMetadata` helper (autoCommit + completed only) that stages `.rex/prd_tree` and commits it in a small dedicated second commit, leaving a clean tree. The non-autoCommit path is unchanged (it already stages PRD files alongside the code), guarded by a staged-diff check so no spurious second commit is created.

  Separately, `HenchConfigSchema` was missing `fullTestCommand`, so Zod stripped the key on parse and `loadConfig` returned it as `undefined` — the full-suite test gate always fell back to auto-detect even when `.hench/config.json` set the command. The field is now declared in the schema.

- [#279](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/279) [`18b36f7`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/18b36f73c0b18bdf508b956e3fb42e5bbf5aeabd) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Add a pre-run commit gate to `hench run` / `ndx work`. Once per invocation (before the work loop begins, not per iteration), if the working tree has pre-existing uncommitted changes and the session is interactive, hench shows the diff stat plus an LLM-proposed commit message and prompts to **commit** (stage + commit with the standard N-DX trailers, then proceed), **stop** (abort before running), or **proceed** (start with changes left uncommitted). This keeps a user's in-progress edits from being folded into hench's own commits.

  Autonomous runs (`--auto`/`--loop`/`--epic-by-epic`) can't prompt without stalling an unattended loop, so a dirty working tree makes them **abort by default** rather than silently absorb the pre-existing changes. Pass the new `--allow-dirty` flag to start an autonomous run against a dirty tree anyway. Clean trees, `--yes` runs, and other non-interactive sessions proceed without prompting as before.

- [#317](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/317) [`68616e5`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/68616e550d0b062cee6add7e18df69a65164dd92) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Make the hench pre-run commit gate size-aware with configurable thresholds.

  The gate now measures change magnitude (dirty file count plus lines changed vs HEAD via `git diff --numstat`, shared helper `measureChangeMagnitude`) instead of reacting only to a non-empty dirty list. Two new persisted settings under `hench.git.*` (`.hench/config.json`, editable via `ndx config`):

  - **`hench.git.checkpointThreshold`** (default: 200, 0 disables) — at/above this many changed lines, the interactive prompt warns about the change size and defaults to committing a checkpoint instead of proceeding. Below the threshold, behavior is unchanged.
  - **`hench.git.requireCleanTree`** (default: false) — refuse to start against a dirty tree: the interactive prompt drops the "proceed" option and non-interactive runs (`--yes`, piped) abort.

  Autonomous runs (`--auto`/`--loop`/`--epic-by-epic`) keep today's behavior — abort on any dirty tree unless `--allow-dirty` — but the refusal now reports the measured magnitude. `--allow-dirty` takes precedence over both config settings for a single run (flag > config > defaults). Documented in `hench run --help` and `ndx config --help`.

- [#316](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/316) [`c5fdbed`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/c5fdbed684ee91e1b6ceeb77b64bbb3f12b98600) Thanks [@stevemikedan](https://github.com/stevemikedan)! - fix(hench): make parent auto-completion self-healing so cascades are no longer silently lost ([#293](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/issues/293))

  During `hench run --auto --loop`, a child task could be persisted as `completed` while the parent auto-completion cascade was silently dropped — leaving parent features stuck `pending` with every child done, and no reconciliation path to recover. The cause: in `toolRexUpdateStatus` the `status_updated` log append and the cascade shared the caller's single best-effort `try/catch`, so a log-append failure after the child's status write cancelled the cascade; and the cascade was event-driven (`findAutoCompletions` walks only the triggering item's ancestor chain), so a missed cascade was never retried.

  Two changes:

  - **rex:** add `reconcileAutoCompletions(items)` — a whole-tree, bottom-up sweep that completes every parent whose children are all terminal (`completed`/`deferred`), independent of any single trigger item. It self-heals parents whose earlier cascade was lost. Exported from `public.ts`.
  - **hench:** in `toolRexUpdateStatus`, wrap the `status_updated` append in its own try/catch so a log failure can no longer cancel the cascade, and drive the cascade with `reconcileAutoCompletions` (via `rex-gateway`) for whole-tree healing. Cascade failures in `updateCompletedTaskStatus` and the finalize path are now recorded in `run.diagnostics.notes` instead of a console-only warning.

- [#317](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/317) [`68616e5`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/68616e550d0b062cee6add7e18df69a65164dd92) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Make the `rollbackOnFailure` revert **prompt-only** — a failed run never discards work without an express, per-run confirmation. On an interactive TTY, a failed run prompts `Revert N uncommitted file(s)? [y/N]` (defaults to **No**); only an explicit yes reverts — and even then the revert stays scoped ([#303](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/issues/303)): tracked changes are reverted via `git reset`/`checkout`, but untracked removal is limited to files the agent created this run (diffed against the pre-run baseline); pre-existing untracked work is never deleted. Declining preserves the working tree.

  Non-interactive runs — autonomous (`--auto`/`--loop`/`--epic-by-epic`), `--yes`, and non-TTY/CI — have no channel for a per-run confirmation, so they **never** revert on failure: the working tree is left exactly as-is and the uncommitted files are reported. This replaces the previous unattended auto-revert. `--no-rollback` / `hench.rollbackOnFailure: false` still suppresses the prompt entirely. PRD status reset on failure is unchanged.

- [#316](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/316) [`c5fdbed`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/c5fdbed684ee91e1b6ceeb77b64bbb3f12b98600) Thanks [@stevemikedan](https://github.com/stevemikedan)! - fix(hench): scope failure rollback to agent-created files and honor `--no-rollback` on review rejection ([#303](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/issues/303))

  Rollback on run failure previously ran a blanket `git clean -fd`, deleting **every** untracked file in the working tree — including the user's pre-existing scratch, `.env`, and other hidden files that git had never tracked and could not recover. It also reverted unconditionally when a reviewer rejected changes, ignoring the `--no-rollback` flag entirely.

  `revertChanges` now captures a baseline of untracked files before the agent runs (`captureBaselineUntracked`, mirroring `captureStartingHead`) and removes **only** the untracked files the agent created during that run, via a scoped `git clean -fd -- <paths>`. Pre-existing untracked files are never touched. When no baseline is available it deletes nothing (safe fallback). Tracked-file changes are still reverted via `git reset` + `git checkout` (recoverable from history). The review-rejection path now honors `rollbackOnFailure`/`--no-rollback` and reuses the same interactive confirmation prompt as the failure path. The baseline is threaded through both the API/Gemini (`loop.ts`) and CLI (`cli-loop.ts`) run loops.

- [#298](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/298) [`1031719`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/1031719e295722833e2982c720e93ff56a929fad) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Reconcile Codex model identifiers across the config surface. Removed the dead `gpt-5.4mini` legacy alias from `LEGACY_CODEX_MODEL_ALIASES` (its target `gpt-5.4-mini` is already a direct catalog model and the non-hyphen key was never a shipped ID). The remaining legacy brand IDs (`gpt-5-codex`, `gpt-5.1-codex-max`, `gpt-5.1-codex-mini`) now match the orchestration-tier list in `init-llm.js`, with cross-reference comments pinning the two tiers together. Updated the hench vendor-compatibility error hint from the outdated `gpt-4o, o1` to current Codex models (`gpt-5.5, gpt-5.4-mini`).

- [#299](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/299) [`ab24172`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/ab241723f3822cca76e801d4628289b3c45b0b84) Thanks [@stevemikedan](https://github.com/stevemikedan)! - Harden CLI spawning on Windows so launching `.cmd` shims (claude, codex, rex) no longer fails. Node can't spawn a `.cmd` directly (post-CVE-2024-27980), and the previous `shell: process.platform === "win32"` workaround triggered the `[DEP0190]` deprecation and broke on paths containing spaces.

  - **New `spawnCli` helper** (`@n-dx/llm-client`) routes CLI binaries through `cmd.exe /d /s /c` with `windowsVerbatimArguments` and never uses `shell:true`. Argument quoting follows the Microsoft ArgvQuote / cross-spawn rules (unconditional quoting, backslash-run doubling before quotes, embedded-quote doubling) so paths with spaces and tokens with cmd.exe metacharacters (`& | < > ^ ( )`) are handled. The orchestration tier (`@n-dx/core`) carries an equivalent `win-spawn.js` twin (it cannot import `@n-dx/llm-client`), kept in lockstep by a cross-package parity test.
  - **All CLI-binary spawn sites** are routed through the helper: the claude and codex providers, the hench agent loop and its adapters, the `ndx config` CLI-path validator, `ndx pair-programming`'s reviewer, and sourcevision's `rex` invocations.
  - **Prompts are delivered via stdin** for the codex hench adapter and the pair-programming reviewer (previously passed as an argv token), preventing multi-line prompt truncation and command injection through `cmd.exe`.
  - **`diagnoseCliInvocation`** produces an actionable message when a CLI binary is missing or not invokable — distinguishing a not-found binary, a configured absolute path that doesn't exist, and a binary present on PATH but failing to run — and works from the close/non-zero-exit path on Windows (where a missing `.cmd` never raises `ENOENT`). Detection is anchored to the spawned binary so a legitimate run's own error output isn't misclassified.
  - A **regression guard test** fails CI if any CLI spawn site reintroduces the `shell:true` + args (`DEP0190`) pattern.

  No behavior change on macOS or Linux.

The `/ndx-work` skill drove tasks through Claude Code without spawning hench, so the work left no `.hench/runs/` entry and was invisible to run history and `ndx usage`. A new `hench record` command writes a lightweight run record (task id, title, status, summary, timestamps, model) marked `assisted`, and the skill now calls it as a final step. Because Claude Code does not expose its own token consumption to a running skill, assisted records carry empty token usage and an `assisted` flag so analytics can distinguish them from genuine hench runs rather than reading them as anomalies; the skill also surfaces this caveat to the user.

### Patch Changes

- [#224](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/224) [`aca6ede`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/aca6ede08e1182b5307a27e17ee320a33066b8a8) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - Stop assuming every project is JS/TS during `hench init`.

  - Detect Swift projects (`Package.swift`, `*.xcodeproj`, `*.xcworkspace`) and
    apply a Swift guard profile: `allowedCommands: ["swift", "make",
"xcodebuild", "xcrun", "git"]`, Swift-aware blocked paths
    (`.build/`, `DerivedData/`, `Pods/`, `Carthage/`), and longer timeouts to
    fit Xcode build times. Adds `"swift"` to `ProjectLanguage`.
  - `autoDetectTestCommand` now prefers a Makefile `validate` target over the
    raw language toolchain — a strong "project author wrapped the full gate
    here" signal — and falls back to per-language defaults for Swift (`swift
test`), Cargo (`cargo test`), Go (`go test ./...`), and Python (`pytest`)
    before giving up.

  Net effect: on a Swift codebase with a `make validate` gate, `ndx init`
  yields a usable `.hench/config.json` with the right toolchain allowed AND
  the resolver picks up `make validate` automatically — no manual
  `hench.fullTestCommand` override needed.

  **PRD context graph (web)** — Top-down progressive-disclosure layout with folder-tree
  visual style; shape-based nodes for epic/feature/task/subtask; click-through opens the
  Rex task detail panel with subtree highlighting. Hierarchy is now driven from
  `.rex/prd_tree/` paths.

  **Hench run loop** — Per-task attempt tracking, completed tasks excluded from
  selection, and the loop advances immediately on success. The `no-plan-mode` rule is
  embedded in the agent system prompt; autonomous runs (`--auto` / `--loop` /
  `--epic-by-epic`) default to `acceptEdits`. New
  `docs/contributing/run-loop-invariants.md`.

  **LLM auto-failover** — New `llm.autoFailover` flag with vendor-specific failover
  chains; `hench run` restores the original config after a failover attempt. Model
  resolution honours top-level `llm.model` → `llm.{vendor}.model` → tier default.

  **Rex storage** — PRD tree rewritten to canonical `index.md`-per-folder layout with
  single-child compaction and atomic leaf-to-folder promotion for subtasks. Timestamped
  snapshots before structural migrations; cross-PRD duplicate detection in `reshape`.

  **CLI / DX** — New `ndx tree` command and tree-formatted `rex status`; `ndx self-heal`
  gains a pre-execution approval gate with `selfHeal.autoConfirm`. Obfuscated-code commit
  blocker added.

### Minor Changes

- [#198](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/198) [`4de9d46`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/4de9d46036963129b0e962e1c9aed7e0b9d87262) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Address security findings, fix package publishing regression, and refresh documentation.

  **Security** — clears 27 of 30 Dependabot advisories:

  - `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` ^1.25.3 → ^1.29.0 (rex, sourcevision, web) — fixes cross-client data leak via shared transport reuse (GHSA-345p-7cg4-v4c7) plus transitive `hono`, `@hono/node-server`, `path-to-regexp`, `ajv`, and `qs` advisories.
  - `@anthropic-ai/sdk` ^0.85.0 → ^0.94.0 (hench, llm-client) — fixes insecure default file permissions in the local-filesystem memory tool (GHSA-p7fg-763f-g4gf).
  - `vitest` ^4.0.18 → ^4.1.5 (root) — fixes transitive `vite` and `picomatch` advisories.
  - Adds range-scoped `pnpm.overrides` for `picomatch`, `postcss`, `hono`, `@hono/node-server`, `ajv`, `path-to-regexp`, `qs`, and `vite` to pin patched versions in transitive trees the resolver would otherwise leave on older cached versions.

  Audit drops from 11 high / 21 moderate / 2 low to 1 high / 2 moderate. The remaining advisories (rollup, esbuild, vite reached via `vitepress`) are dev-server-only docs-build vulns deferred to a follow-up.

  **Packaging regression guard** — moves `assistant-assets/` under `packages/core/` so it ships inside the published `@n-dx/core` tarball, and adds two e2e tests to prevent recurrence:

  - `tests/e2e/published-assets-bundled.test.js` — asserts `pnpm pack` includes the assistant-assets payload.
  - `tests/e2e/published-package-loadability.test.js` — installs each packed tarball into a clean fixture and verifies CLIs load.

  **Docs** — README, getting-started, and quickstart updates with screenshots in `documentation/` to walk through `ndx init`, `analyze`, `plan`, `work`, `status`, `start`, `ci`, and `self-heal`.

  - **`llm-client`**: Add `VENDOR_CONTEXT_CHAR_LIMITS` — per-vendor safe prompt size constants (claude: 640K chars, codex: 400K chars) derived from each vendor's context window.
  - **`hench/summary.ts`**: Recognise Codex CLI tool names (`shell`, `str_replace_editor`, `create_file`) in `buildRunSummary`. Fixes IC-1: file-change tracking now works for Codex runs.
  - **`hench/cli-loop.ts`**: Bound the brief text to `VENDOR_CONTEXT_CHAR_LIMITS[vendor]` before each dispatch. Uses the vendor/model resolver from `llm-gateway` rather than a Claude-specific constant.
  - **`hench/shared.ts`**: When `toolCalls` is empty in self-heal mode, fall back to `git diff --name-only HEAD` to populate `filesChanged`. Fixes IC-2: the mandatory test gate now runs for Codex (which does not emit structured tool events).
