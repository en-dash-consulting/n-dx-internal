### Patch Changes

- [#351](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/351) [`d21d0ab`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/d21d0ab9d291fe444726d038415d8cddd5fc8e8e) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Stop the pre-run git gate self-blocking on hench's own lock directory
  
  `ndx work --auto` on a project without hench's `.gitignore` entries refused to
  start with "Refusing to start an autonomous run with 1 uncommitted file(s), 0
  line(s) changed in the working tree" — and left a clean tree behind, so the
  message looked unreproducible. The dirt was `.hench/locks/`, created at process
  startup before the gate runs and removed again on exit.
  
  The gate now discounts hench's own runtime artifacts (`.hench/locks/`,
  `.hench/runs/`, `.hench/usage-cursors/`, `.hench-commit-msg.txt`) when reading
  `git status --porcelain`, so a lock the run itself created can never count as
  operator dirt. `.hench/config.json` is deliberately not discounted — it is
  operator-authored and a pending change to it should still stop the run.
  
  `hench init` also now writes those `.gitignore` entries ahead of its
  already-initialized early return, so a project initialized before the entries
  existed picks them up on the next `ndx init` instead of staying exposed.

- [#351](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/351) [`d21d0ab`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/d21d0ab9d291fe444726d038415d8cddd5fc8e8e) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - fix(hench): stop reporting a clean dependency audit for one that never ran
  
  `runDependencyAudit` failed OPEN. Both of its steps guarded the parse on
  `stdout` being non-empty, and a command that cannot be spawned comes back from
  `exec` as exitCode 1 with empty stdout — so the parse was skipped, the all-zero
  initializer was returned untouched, and the function answered `ran: true`. The
  caller then printed `✓ No vulnerabilities or outdated packages found` for an
  audit that had executed nothing. Two bare `catch {}` blocks discarded any throw
  on the way. This was the reverse of the direction a security-adjacent check
  should fail, and worse than being loudly wrong: it was silently reassuring.
  
  Each step is now classified, and every way of failing to produce counts is
  reported as `ran: false` with a reason: never launched (naming the spawn error),
  killed on timeout, a non-zero exit with no output (carrying the stderr tail, so
  `ERR_PNPM_NO_LOCKFILE` reaches the operator), unparseable JSON, and a payload
  that parses but carries no vulnerability data — pnpm reports its own errors as
  JSON too. `exitCode 0` with no output stays a real empty report, because
  `pnpm outdated --json` prints nothing when every dependency is current.
  
  `DependencyAuditResult` now has a three-outcome contract — ran, partial, and
  inconclusive — with per-step `commands.audit` / `commands.outdated` records
  saying which half failed and why. **An inconclusive audit warns and proceeds**,
  and the reasoning is recorded on the type: the audit gates nothing today (a run
  with ten critical vulnerabilities proceeds), so a `pnpm` that will not spawn must
  not be a harder stop than the vulnerabilities themselves; the defect being fixed
  is the false clean bill of health, not the decision to continue. A future gate
  that wants to fail closed can already distinguish the state.
  
  The dead `hasIssues` computation is gone. It was this defect in miniature —
  OR-ing over counts a never-launched step had left at zero — and nothing read it.

- [#351](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/351) [`d21d0ab`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/d21d0ab9d291fe444726d038415d8cddd5fc8e8e) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Run shell commands in a shell that exists on Windows.
  
  `execShellCmd` hardcoded `sh -c` on every platform. On Windows `sh` ships with
  Git for Windows and is on PATH only inside Git Bash, so from PowerShell or
  cmd.exe — the default shells — the spawn failed with ENOENT. `exec` reported
  that as `exitCode: 1` with empty output, which is indistinguishable from a
  command that ran and failed: hench's test gate concluded the suite was broken
  after essentially every task, and `rex verify` reported `passed: false` for
  tests that never started.
  
  `execShellCmd` now resolves the shell per platform — `sh -c` wherever a POSIX
  shell is resolvable, `cmd.exe /d /s /c` on a Windows box without one. POSIX
  behaviour is unchanged, and Windows machines that have Git for Windows keep
  POSIX semantics rather than being switched to cmd.exe.
  
  `ExecResult` gains `launched`, which is `false` when the command never started.
  Callers that infer pass/fail from `exitCode` alone can no longer mistake an
  unlaunchable command for a failing one; `rex verify` and hench's `run_command`
  now report the two cases differently.
  
  The two remaining sites that spawned `sh` directly (hench's `execShell`, rex's
  `verify`) are routed through `execShellCmd`, and an architecture-policy guard
  fails the build if a new one appears.

- [#351](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/351) [`d21d0ab`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/d21d0ab9d291fe444726d038415d8cddd5fc8e8e) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Charge the adversarial review pass's per-turn tokens to the run record.
  
  `runAdversarialReviewPass` added the reviewer's aggregate spend to
  `run.tokenUsage` but never merged `result.turnTokenUsage` into
  `run.turnTokenUsage` — `accumulateResult` is the only path that concats the
  per-turn array, and the review pass does not go through it.
  
  The per-turn half is the one that reaches the rollups. Rex's
  `extractHenchTokenEvents` builds its usage events from `turnTokenUsage`
  whenever that array is non-empty and then advances to the next run; it never
  falls back to the aggregate. A run carrying only the executor's turns
  therefore reports only the executor's spend, however large `tokenUsage` grew.
  
  Measured on live run 5c1e9bee (executor claude-sonnet-4-6, reviewer
  claude-opus-5): `run.tokenUsage.output` was 28,920 while all 20 per-turn
  entries were tagged sonnet and summed to 3,154 output. `ndx usage` printed the
  aggregate as its headline (29,082) and the per-turn sum as the per-command
  line (3,200) in the same report — an 89% under-report — and priced the whole
  run at Sonnet rates although roughly 25.8k of the 28.9k output tokens were
  billed to opus-5.
  
  The two halves now move together in one place, `chargeReviewToRun`. The
  reviewer's turn numbers restart at 1, so they are offset past the executor's
  highest turn to keep `turn` monotonic within a run. Entries are tagged with
  the review model, with an unresolved model (the local vendor sends no model
  flag) normalized from `""` to absent so the `turn.model ?? run.model` fallback
  downstream still engages. A reviewer that reports no per-turn data contributes
  none rather than one synthetic entry — fabricated per-turn data is
  indistinguishable from measured data once written.

- [#351](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/351) [`d21d0ab`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/d21d0ab9d291fe444726d038415d8cddd5fc8e8e) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - fix(hench): stop failing a run for a test suite that never started
  
  `runTestGate` inferred pass/fail from `exitCode` alone. A command that cannot
  be spawned comes back from `exec` as exitCode 1 with empty stdout and stderr —
  byte for byte what a real failing exit looks like — so the only thing separating
  "your tests failed" from "the suite never started" is `ExecResult.launched`,
  which was never read.
  
  The consequences ran well past a misleading message. In autonomous mode the gate
  failure aborted the run, which set `run.status = "failed"`, which skipped
  `updateCompletedTaskStatus` and short-circuited the commit prompt. Finished,
  committed work went unrecorded in the PRD, the loop re-selected the same task,
  and three strikes auto-cancelled it. Operators saw `✗ 0/0 package(s) failed` and
  `Test gate failed:` with nothing after the colon. On Windows without a POSIX
  shell this fired on essentially every task until b5a3a3e0 fixed shell resolution.
  
  Now:
  
  - A gate that could not be executed is reported as `ran: false` with an error
    naming the spawn failure — inconclusive, not a verdict. `TestGateResult` says
    so explicitly: check `ran` before `passed`.
  - The lifecycle treats that as inconclusive and leaves `run.status` alone, so the
    PRD write and the commit still happen, and prints a distinct message rather
    than claiming a test failure.
  - The retry loop terminates instead of spinning to the 5-attempt cap re-running a
    command that cannot launch, then failing the run for exhausting its retries.
  - A gate failure with no package results names a reason instead of ending in a
    bare colon.
  
  The same `launched` gap is fixed in `runTestsForFiles`, `runTypecheck` (cleanup
  transformations — still fails closed, since it guards a mutation, but no longer
  reports a spawn failure as type errors), and completion validation. The rex
  requirements executor folds the spawn error into stderr, since its contract has
  no field for it. `runDependencyAudit` was left annotated and tracked separately,
  because its fail-open behaviour was a design decision about a security-adjacent
  check rather than a mechanical one; it is fixed in its own changeset.

- [#351](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/351) [`d21d0ab`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/d21d0ab9d291fe444726d038415d8cddd5fc8e8e) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - fix(hench): show the actual test failure instead of `0/0 package(s) failed`
  
  The gate threw away every diagnostic for the test command it selects by default.
  `parseVitestOutput` expected vitest JSON, but `autoDetectTestCommand` returns
  `npm run test` whenever package.json has a `test` script — most repos, and this
  one, where it runs `scripts/run-all-tests.mjs` and prints a human-readable
  summary. `JSON.parse` threw, the fallback searched only stderr while that runner
  writes its summary to stdout, and an empty array came back. The lifecycle
  rendered it as `✗ 0/0 package(s) failed` with no output to print, so a real
  failure was indistinguishable from a suite that never launched — and neither
  said anything useful.
  
  - The parser reads both streams and never returns an empty array for a run that
    produced output. When it cannot parse, it surfaces the raw output instead of
    reporting nothing.
  - Failing packages are named only from lines carrying a failure marker. Scanning
    the whole output collected every package the run mentioned, which would have
    reported five passing packages as failures alongside the one that failed.
  - Raw output is taken from stdout and stderr combined. Vitest puts `×` markers on
    stdout and the AssertionError block on stderr, and the existing helper takes
    `stdout || stderr` — so the operator was told which test failed but not why.
  - A passing run is reported as passing with no output attached, so the package
    count is honest on the happy path too.
  - Timeouts report distinctly, naming both the budget and the elapsed time and
    keeping whatever output arrived before the kill. A timeout still fails the run:
    a gate that cannot finish on freshly changed code is a reason to stop.
  
  `TEST_GATE_TIMEOUT` raised 5m → 15m. The full suite here measures 248s idle —
  83% of the old ceiling — and the gate runs while the agent's own subprocesses are
  still competing for cores. It is a hang guardrail, not a latency SLA, and the
  measurement is recorded next to the constant.
  
  Verified end to end by running the real gate against a deliberately failing test:
  the output now carries the test name, `AssertionError: expected 42 to be 43`, and
  the source line.

  `.hench/session-cache.json` is rewritten on every orientation, but it was absent from `HENCH_RUNTIME_GITIGNORE_ENTRIES` and from both ignore lists, so `git add -A` in the pre-run commit gate swept it into commits — and a later run then saw its own write as one uncommitted file and refused to start. It is now ignored, discounted by the gate, and written by `hench init`. The ignore template test additionally pins every declared runtime artifact to both ignore files, so the constant can no longer drift away from them.

### Patch Changes

- [#346](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/346) [`4e0ca1c`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/4e0ca1c4c220f58855ade454e72c9500391dd0ec) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Implement the batch session strategy, so `hench.sessionStrategy: "batch"` does
  what it already claimed to.
  
  That value was documented, accepted by config, and returned by strategy
  resolution — but the run loop only acted on `"fork"`, so setting it silently
  produced cold spawns.
  
  Batching resumes the *previous task's* session rather than forking a fixed
  orientation, so the transcript accumulates. That is not a lesser fallback: it
  is the correct shape for a CLI whose resume appends rather than branches, which
  is exactly what `codex exec resume` does — it has no `--fork-session`
  equivalent. It also makes `hench.tasksPerSession` load-bearing rather than
  cosmetic, since an unbounded shared transcript costs more on every later turn
  and lets one task's framing bleed into the next.
  
  The chain lives in the session cache beside the orientation parent, because
  the run loop executes once per task and the chain has to survive between
  calls. Writes merge rather than replace, so neither strategy discards the
  other's state, and `--fresh` no longer clears a batch chain — re-orienting is
  not the same as forgetting everything. A chain advances only after a
  *completed* task: a failed task's transcript now contains the failure, and
  resuming it would start the next task inside it.
  
  Briefs after the first are prefixed with an emphatic task-boundary divider —
  naming the previous task finished, forbidding its plan from being resumed,
  demoting earlier turns to background, and telling the model to re-read files
  because the working tree has moved. Cross-task pollution is batching's known
  cost, and a subtle marker would not have addressed it.
  
  Verified against the live Claude CLI: three chained tasks all reported the same
  session id (appended, not branched), the second recalled a fact planted in the
  first, and the third could count the earlier tasks. The codex leg is captured
  as a follow-up rather than shipped unverified — that adapter has no session
  handling yet, and its session-id event shape could not be confirmed here.

- [#346](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/346) [`4e0ca1c`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/4e0ca1c4c220f58855ade454e72c9500391dd0ec) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Wire the batch session strategy to the Codex CLI.
  
  Codex is the vendor batching most benefits: it has no `--fork-session`
  equivalent, so resuming the previous task's thread is its only route out of
  per-task cold starts. The strategy resolution and the chain bookkeeping were
  already vendor-neutral; two pieces were missing.
  
  The adapter now emits `codex exec resume <id>` when given a `resumeSessionId`,
  instead of always opening a fresh `exec`. That branch deliberately passes no
  policy flags: `codex exec resume` accepts neither `-s/--sandbox` nor
  `--approve-for-me`, and passing either aborts the spawn on argument parsing —
  sandbox and approval policy belong to the thread being resumed. It never uses
  `--last`, which resolves to the newest recorded session *globally* and would
  let any other codex run on the machine capture the chain.
  
  Session-id extraction moved onto the adapter as `extractSessionId`, replacing a
  hardcoded `session_id` lookup in the run loop. The key differs per vendor, and
  codex's was verified against codex-cli 0.147.0 rather than assumed — it arrives
  as `thread_id` on a single `thread.started` event. `session_id` appears only in
  the on-disk rollout file, which is a different format from the `--json` stream;
  a reasonable guess would have been wrong. Resuming re-emits the same id, so the
  chain keeps counting one thread instead of restarting every task.
  
  Adapters that declare no `extractSessionId` fall back to the previous
  `session_id` behaviour.

- [#346](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/346) [`4e0ca1c`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/4e0ca1c4c220f58855ade454e72c9500391dd0ec) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Stop emitting `--full-auto`, which `codex exec` no longer accepts.
  
  `compileCodexPolicyFlags` returned `["--full-auto"]` for `workspace-write` +
  `never` — the autonomous default. codex-cli 0.147.0 removed that flag from
  `codex exec`, so every unattended codex spawn died on argument parsing before
  reaching the model: `error: unexpected argument '--full-auto' found`. The whole
  codex agent path was broken.
  
  Both halves of the policy are now stated explicitly — `--sandbox <mode>` plus
  `-c approval_policy=<value>`, since `codex exec` has no approval flag. That is
  also more robust than a preset: a preset is a name codex can retire, while
  `--sandbox` and `approval_policy` are the settings it was composed from. The
  one preset kept is `danger-full-access` + `never` →
  `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`, still on the exec surface and the
  only way to express "no sandbox at all".
  
  `mapApprovalToCodexFlag` returned `"default"` and `"full-auto"` — names of exec
  flags, not `approval_policy` values, and both gone. It now returns the config
  values codex accepts (`on-request`, `never`), read off the CLI's own rejection
  message, and the compiler uses it so the mapping is single-sourced.
  
  The gap that let this ship was that every test asserted our flags against our
  own expectations. A new integration test scrapes `--help` from the *installed*
  codex and asserts each flag we emit is one that binary accepts, for both `exec`
  and `exec resume` — so the next arg-surface drift fails a test instead of
  silently breaking every run. It skips when codex is absent, and says so.
  
  Verified end to end against codex-cli 0.147.0: a real autonomous spawn now
  exits 0 with `turn.completed`, and resuming that thread answers from the prior
  turn with 85% of input tokens served from cache — the batch session strategy
  working on codex for the first time.

- [#346](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/346) [`4e0ca1c`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/4e0ca1c4c220f58855ade454e72c9500391dd0ec) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Fix the full-suite gate skipping runs that changed files — including every run
  the adversarial review pass had just repaired.
  
  The gate read `filesChanged` from the model's own summary of what it had done,
  with a git fallback that only fired when the loop recorded no tool calls at
  all. The Claude CLI always records tool calls, so on the default path the
  fallback never ran and an empty summary meant the gate skipped, reporting "no
  files modified" for runs that had modified files. Review-pass repairs could
  not be seen either way: they happen in a separate spawn, after the summary is
  parsed.
  
  Changed files are now derived from git, against the commit the run started
  from rather than HEAD. That baseline matters: on the autoCommit path the
  executor commits its own work before the gate runs, so a HEAD-relative diff
  reports nothing and the gate would skip the very run it should test. The
  pre-run baseline sees committed work and still-uncommitted reviewer repairs
  alike, plus newly untracked files, excluding untracked paths that were already
  present when the run started (those are the user's, not the run's).
  
  Discovery returns "git could not answer" distinctly from "nothing changed", so
  a repo without git leaves the previous model-reported list in place instead of
  being overridden by a guess. Untracked files are enumerated with
  `--untracked-files=all` so a new directory yields its individual files: the
  gate aggregates per file path, and a bare `src/` names no file and maps to no
  package.

- [#346](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/346) [`4e0ca1c`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/4e0ca1c4c220f58855ade454e72c9500391dd0ec) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Bound the context handed to a task: `--context-file`, sibling lists, inherited
  requirements, and `workflow.md`.
  
  A brief is rebuilt and re-sent for every task and every retry, so anything
  unbounded in it is a cost multiplied by the whole loop — and three of its
  sections grew with the *project* rather than with the task. Sibling lists are
  now capped at 20 and inherited requirements at 25, `workflow.md` is trimmed at
  4,000 characters, and `--context-file` — read straight off disk with no bound,
  while `ndx work` pipes the entire CONTEXT.md plus PRD tree through it — is
  trimmed at 24,000 characters with a warning naming the file.
  
  Inherited requirements are also deduplicated. `collectRequirements` walks the
  whole parent chain, so a constraint restated at several levels arrived once per
  level; the nearest-parent copy is kept, since its attribution is the more
  specific one.
  
  Every cap reports what it dropped, with the omitted count and the total. That
  matters more here than the numbers: an agent that cannot tell an absent
  constraint from an unmentioned one will confidently act as though it does not
  exist. `workflow.md` is trimmed at a line boundary for the same reason — a
  mid-line cut would turn "do not delete X" into a complete-looking different
  rule.

- [#346](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/346) [`4e0ca1c`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/4e0ca1c4c220f58855ade454e72c9500391dd0ec) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Complete light-tier routing: move classification to the light tier, and give
  the two unguarded light calls real output contracts.
  
  `sourcevision`'s classification batches now resolve through the `code.classify`
  task class. This is the last of the audit's routing-map flips and the safest of
  them: a fixed-size batch goes in, an enum-constrained list comes out, unknown
  paths and unknown archetype ids are already dropped per item, and a prompt
  degradation ladder already handles parse failures — so a wrong answer costs one
  dropped classification.
  
  Routing a call to the cheapest adequate model is only a safe trade while bad
  output stays detectable, and two light-routed calls had nothing checking them.
  
  The commit-subject call feeds `git commit -m` directly, and previously took the
  first non-empty line and sliced it to 100 characters — so a fenced block, a
  "Sure! Here's a subject:" preamble, or a markdown bullet would have been
  committed into the repository's history. It now goes through a contract that
  strips those tics and enforces one line within the documented 72-character
  bound, falling back to the generic message when nothing usable survives:
  refusing to commit would be worse than committing under a generic subject.
  
  The body-merge call was worse — whatever the model returned was written verbatim
  as the surviving PRD item's description, so an empty answer or a JSON blob would
  have been persisted as the item's body. It now validates, and *throws* on
  failure rather than repairing: `reshape` already treats body merge as
  best-effort and keeps the existing description, which beats persisting a
  preamble or a sentence cut in half by a length cap.
  
  The other six light-routed sites were audited and already had contracts — zod
  schemas for renames, clarify rounds and the assessment pass, and proposal
  parsing with count checks for the consolidation guard. A new integration test
  pins the resolved model for every class in the routing map, in both directions:
  the light routes must be light, and the agent loop, proposal generation, and
  deep enrichment must not be.

- [#346](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/346) [`4e0ca1c`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/4e0ca1c4c220f58855ade454e72c9500391dd0ec) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Commit adversarial-review repairs on the autoCommit path instead of orphaning
  them in the working tree.
  
  On `--yes`/auto runs the executor commits its own work before the review pass
  runs, the reviewer is barred from committing, and the completion-metadata
  commit stages only `.rex/prd_tree` — so a must-fix repair the reviewer applied
  in-session was owned by nobody and got swept into whatever commit happened
  next (observed end-to-end in the review-pass verification).
  
  The reviewer spawn is now bracketed by working-tree snapshots (dirty paths →
  content hash), and the diff — exactly what the reviewer changed, never
  pre-existing dirt — is recorded on the run as `review.repairedFiles` and
  committed on the autoCommit path as a dedicated pathspec commit referencing
  the run and task (`review.repairCommit`). Interactive runs are unchanged: the
  commit prompt already sweeps repairs into the task's commit. A repair commit
  that cannot be made is reported with the leftover paths, never thrown — an
  uncommitted repair is an inspection burden, not a broken task.

  orientation session cache, and the session-strategy config keys.
  
  The Claude CLI adapter gains `forkSession`, emitting `--fork-session` after
  `--resume` so a spawn can inherit a parent transcript under a new session id
  without mutating the parent. Forking without a session to fork from is
  suppressed rather than passed through — it would claim a fork that never
  happened.
  
  A new `agent/lifecycle/session-cache.ts` owns which orientation session
  exists and whether it is still safe to fork. Finding a parent is permissive
  (absent, unreadable, or corrupt cache files are all simply a miss, costing one
  orientation spawn); *using* one is strict, because a stale hit would have
  every task in a loop inherit an orientation describing a repo that has since
  changed. A parent is rejected, with a named reason, when the sourcevision
  analysis fingerprint changes, when it ages past `hench.parentMaxAgeHours`,
  when the vendor or model differs from the one it was built under, or when
  `--fresh` is requested.
  
  New config: `hench.sessionStrategy` (`fork` | `batch` | `cold`),
  `hench.tasksPerSession` (default 4), and `hench.parentMaxAgeHours` (default
  24), documented in `ndx config --help`. Strategy resolution degrades rather
  than errors: forking needs a CLI that resumes by session id, so other vendors
  and `provider=api` resolve to `cold`.
  
  No spawn behavior changes yet — the orientation pass and fork wiring that
  consume this land next.

- [#346](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/346) [`4e0ca1c`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/4e0ca1c4c220f58855ade454e72c9500391dd0ec) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Bound the spawns one task can make, and retry by resuming the failed session
  rather than cold-restarting it.
  
  **Breaking-ish behaviour change:** plan-mode re-spawns now consume the retry
  budget. Previously they were a separate per-attempt allowance, so four retries
  against up to three plan re-spawns each could reach twelve cold spawns for a
  single task — every one re-paying the harness prompt, the project
  instructions, and the repo re-exploration. Making them additive means a task
  that spends its budget entering plan mode gets correspondingly fewer failure
  retries than it did before.
  
  A hard ceiling sits on top of the retry budget, defaulting to 8 and
  configurable via `hench.maxSpawnsPerTask`. The two layers are not redundant:
  some re-spawn paths deliberately *avoid* charging the retry budget, because
  nothing was learned about the task — a plan-mode interception, the
  stale-parent fork fallback. The ceiling counts every spawn regardless of why
  it happened, so no future re-spawn path can reintroduce unbounded
  multiplication by simply not asking. It is checked before spawning, so it
  refuses to spend rather than reporting that the spending already happened, and
  hitting it fails the task with the full breakdown.
  
  Transient failures on the Claude CLI now retry by resuming the failed session
  — a plain resume, not a fork, since branching off the failure would leave the
  retry without the transcript it exists to continue. The cold-restart retry
  notice is suppressed on those retries: a resumed session *was* the previous
  attempt, so telling it that files from a prior attempt still exist and to check
  the current state before redoing work restates what it just did, and grows the
  prompt on every retry. Vendors with no resume on this path keep cold retries
  and keep the notice.
  
  Runs now record `spawnCount` and `spawnBreakdown`, so `ndx usage` can report
  retry overhead — a task that took four spawns to succeed reads differently
  from one that took one, and six plan re-spawns call for a different fix than
  six failure retries.

  routing config surfaces through the `.n-dx.json` loader.
  
  rex's `spawnClaude`/`resolveConfiguredModel` accept `{ taskClass }` alongside
  the legacy bare weight (the class wins; an explicit model still beats both),
  and the analyze call sites now declare their classes — renames, merges,
  consolidation checks, assessment, and clarify rounds route light by registry
  default exactly as before, while proposals, modify, spec synthesis, smart-add,
  and restructuring declare their standard-tier classes. `prd.decompose` is
  deliberately not declared yet: its registry default is light, and that flip is
  gated on the escalation ladder. sourcevision's `callClaude` gains the same
  option, `resolveLightModel` now resolves through `zone.enrich-scan`, and the
  enrichment passes and meta-evaluation declare their classes. hench resolves
  the agent loop via `agent.execute` (standard by default — but
  `llm.routes["agent.execute"] = "heavy"` now reroutes a run with no code
  change), the pre-run commit message via `git.commit-message`, and CLI-path
  run records carry the resolved tier in `weight` instead of always "standard".
  `loadLLMConfig` passes `llm.tiers`, `llm.routes`, `llm.effort`, and
  `llm.escalation` through its whitelist so the new config actually reaches
  runtime. A repo-level contract test walks declared task classes and fails on
  any class missing from `DEFAULT_ROUTES` or any choke point that stops
  declaring its classes.

  `unresolvedFindings` returns two different things: must-fix findings the pass
  could not repair, and findings of any verdict whose action failed. The review
  warning reported the combined count as "N must-fix finding(s) were not
  repaired", so run 4b4526c5 — whose single unresolved finding was a low/should-fix
  whose PRD capture failed — warned of an unrepaired must-fix. Counting failures
  toward alarm is deliberate; labelling them all must-fix overstates the severity,
  and a warning that cries wolf stops being read.
  
  `classifyUnresolved` now partitions the two, and a failed must-fix lands in the
  must-fix bucket only, so the buckets never double-count. `formatUnresolvedWarning`
  emits one line per reason, and is a pure function beside `formatReviewSummary`
  rather than an inline string in the run loop — the wording was previously
  untested, which is how the mislabel shipped.
  
  `run.review` gains `unrepairedMustFixCount` and `failedActionCount`.
  `unresolvedCount` keeps its meaning as the combined headline, with its doc
  comment corrected: it had claimed to be a must-fix count.

- [#346](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/346) [`4e0ca1c`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/4e0ca1c4c220f58855ade454e72c9500391dd0ec) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Fork task spawns from a warm orientation session instead of cold-starting
  every task.
  
  A cold task spawn spends its first turns rediscovering the repo — layout,
  build and test commands, conventions — and pays that again on every retry and
  every task in a `--loop`. Hench now runs that once, in a read-only orientation
  session, and spawns each task as a fork of it (`--resume <parent>
  --fork-session`), so tasks arrive already oriented and every fork presents the
  same prefix.
  
  The orientation prompt is deliberately task-free: mention one task in it and
  every fork gets a different prefix, and the first task's framing leaks into
  the rest of the loop. Orientation is also read-only three times over — stated
  in the system prompt, restated in the task prompt, and spawned in `plan` mode
  — because that transcript is inherited by everything downstream.
  
  `cliLoop` runs once per task, so the cache, not loop plumbing, is what makes
  orientation happen once per loop; it also persists across separate `ndx work`
  invocations within the TTL. `ndx work --fresh` discards it, applied once at
  the start of a run rather than per task, so a loop re-orients exactly once.
  
  Two failure modes are handled deliberately. Orientation never fails a run: a
  spawn that errors, throws, or reports no session id simply yields no parent
  and tasks spawn cold. And because a cached parent is validated against its own
  metadata rather than the vendor's session store, a parent the CLI has since
  forgotten would otherwise fail every task in the loop — so the first failed
  fork drops the cache, disables forking for the rest of the run, and re-spawns
  cold without consuming retry budget.
  
  Runs record `parentSessionId` when they forked, making the saving auditable.
  Forking requires a CLI that resumes by session id, so other vendors and
  `provider=api` continue to spawn cold.

### Patch Changes

- [#332](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/332) [`b6be7f7`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/b6be7f7f80232fe9b1b45479040db6f81bf6bbce) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Assisted skill runs now record what they cost, instead of zero.
  
  `hench record` writes the run entry for work driven through a skill rather than a spawned agent. Those entries carried empty token usage, on the stated grounds that "Claude Code does not expose its own token consumption to the running skill". That holds for the tool surface and not for the filesystem: Claude Code writes a JSONL transcript per session in which every assistant message carries the API's `usage` object, and it exports `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` to the tools it runs. So the numbers were readable all along, and `ndx usage` plus the dashboard's per-item rollup were under-reporting every skill-driven task by its entire cost.
  
  Usage is now read from that transcript by default. Two things make the attribution honest rather than merely non-zero:
  
  - **Only the delta.** One session routinely completes several tasks — the session this was built in completed four — so a per-record session total would count the same tokens once per task. A watermark per session lives in `.hench/usage-cursors/`, and each record claims only what accumulated since the last one. It survives transcript compaction by falling back from message uuid to a count, and says when it did.
  - **Only after the work started.** The watermark cannot help the FIRST record in a session, which would otherwise claim everything spent before the task began. Measured against a live session: 549 messages and 127M cache-read tokens for one task. `--startedAt` now doubles as the earliest spend a record may claim, and `/ndx-work` captures it when it marks the task in progress.
  
  Precedence is explicit `--input-tokens`/`--output-tokens`/`--cache-*-tokens` flags, then the transcript, then zeros. A missing or unreadable transcript never fails the record — an unrecorded run is worse than one missing its tokens — and the command reports which happened. `--no-tokens` opts out; `--session` and `--transcript` override discovery.
  
  The `assisted` flag keeps its meaning as provenance (skill vs agent) rather than "no usage", and `turns` is now the transcript's message count, which is a real API-call count.
  
  Skills that mutate state — `/ndx-work`, `/ndx-capture`, `/ndx-plan`, `/ndx-reshape`, `/ndx-config` — record their runs as a documented step. Planning-style skills record against `skill:<name>`, which `get_token_usage` reports in its existing `orphans` bucket: work that produced many items should not be charged to one of them.
  
  Also fixes a test-isolation hazard this created. `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` is exported to `pnpm test` as well, so the suite began reading the ambient live transcript and asserting against numbers that change between runs — green in CI, unreproducible locally. `tests/setup-session-env.js` clears it in every worker, the same shape as the existing `setup-color-env.js` and for the same reason.

- [#332](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/332) [`b6be7f7`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/b6be7f7f80232fe9b1b45479040db6f81bf6bbce) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Make the tests' `sh`-on-PATH dependency explicit instead of failing opaquely.
  
  `sh` is absent from a stock Windows PATH — it ships with Git for Windows, which Git Bash exposes and PowerShell/cmd.exe do not. Tests that spawn `sh -c` therefore passed from Git Bash and failed from PowerShell on the same commit, and no failure message mentioned a shell: the orphan test reported `expected false to be true` after burning a 5s wait, because the grandchild that never started also never wrote its pid. Two of these were investigated as suspected regressions during a merge before the shell was identified as the variable.
  
  The audit found more than the two files that prompted it: **28 shell-dependent cases across 5 files**, of which 21 were failing and **5 were passing vacuously** — a case asserting "nothing was written after the timeout" is trivially satisfied when nothing ever ran, and hench's `reports exit code on failure without output` is satisfied by a spawn that failed to launch. Those were green on machines where the behaviour was never exercised, which is the worse half of this bug.
  
  Each site now skips with `sh` named, via one helper per suite boundary, all delegating to the production `isExecutableOnPath` probe. The `sh` indirection itself is preserved, not removed: libuv puts every non-detached child it spawns on Windows into a global job object, so spawning `node` directly would reap the tree for free and make the tests vacuous — which is how an earlier version of the orphan test managed to prove nothing.
  
  For hench the skip says more, because there `sh` is not scaffolding: `run_command` and the post-task test runner spawn `sh -c` on *every* platform, so a machine without `sh` cannot run those tools at all. The skip records which product capability went unverified rather than implying a test artifact.
  
  Also: shell spawns in tests no longer discard their own failure. `stdio: "ignore"` is about the child's output, and with the spawn error thrown away an unresolvable shell looked identical to a surviving orphan. Full inventory and the rules for adding a new shell-spawning test are in `tests/shell-spawn-inventory.md`.

In rex, `spawnClaude()` gains an optional task-weight parameter (default `"standard"`), and sibling renames, group renames, body merges, the consolidation guard, the granularity assessment pass, guided clarify rounds, and the post-prune consolidation pass now resolve the vendor's light-tier model (e.g. haiku) when no explicit model is given. In hench, pre-run commit-message generation resolves the light tier instead of the run's standard model. An explicit `--model` flag (or a per-vendor `lightModel` config for the light tier) still overrides tier resolution, and the active tier is surfaced in vendor-header/spinner output ("light tier").

- [#342](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/342) [`a7b3227`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/a7b3227e42f778bedb0e19343cf42443f545c167) Thanks [@ryrykeith](https://github.com/ryrykeith)! - Add `ndx work --review`: an adversarial review pass that runs after a task's
  changes validate and before the commit prompt, so must-fix repairs ship in the
  same commit as the work they repair.
  
  **`--review` changes meaning; the old gate is now `--approve-diff`.** The flag
  previously showed the diff and prompted for approval. That gate is unchanged
  apart from its name — pass `--approve-diff` to get it. The two are independent
  and compose: the review pass runs first, so a human answering the diff prompt
  sees the repaired tree rather than the one the implementer left behind. Runs
  that pass `--review` print a line saying where the old behavior went.
  
  **The reviewer resumes the work session.** On the Claude CLI the pass re-enters
  the session that just did the work (`--resume <session-id>`, captured from the
  `session_id` that `--output-format stream-json` stamps on every line) and runs
  it on a stronger model. That inherits what the diff cannot show: which
  approaches were tried and abandoned, which files were read and found
  irrelevant, what the implementer believed it was doing. Vendors whose CLI has no
  resume equivalent — and any run where the session id never arrived — fall back
  to a fresh reviewer seeded with the task, its acceptance criteria, and the
  change's scope.
  
  Resuming invites anchoring, so the reviewer's system prompt is built against it:
  prior reasoning in the conversation is named as evidence under test rather than
  a position to defend, and every finding must carry inputs-to-wrong-result
  concrete enough to be refuted. Findings that cannot be triggered are dropped
  rather than softened.
  
  **Review gets its own model tier, `REVIEW_MODELS`.** Review is read-heavy and
  judgment-dense but short — one diff, one pass — so its token volume is a
  fraction of the run it audits and a stronger model costs little in absolute
  terms. Claude defaults to `claude-opus-5` ($5/$25 per MTok): Opus-tier reasoning
  at the same input price as Opus 4.8, where `claude-fable-5` would cost twice as
  much for a single pass. Codex and Google resolve to their existing top tier;
  local uses whatever is loaded.
  
  Resolution is `--review-model` → `llm.<vendor>.reviewModel` → `llm.reviewModel`
  → the vendor default. `llm.model` and `llm.<vendor>.model` are deliberately
  excluded: inheriting the execution model would mean a project that pins a cheap
  executor silently gets a cheap reviewer, which defeats the reason the tier
  exists. `--review-model` without `--review` is an error rather than a no-op.
  
  **Findings are triaged, not just listed.** Autonomous runs apply the verdict
  policy directly — `must-fix` is repaired in-session with the test that would
  have caught it, `should-fix` and `out-of-scope` are captured as rex items after
  checking `.rex/prd_tree/` for an existing item describing the same defect, and
  `not-worth-fixing` is reported with its reason. Interactive runs still stop and
  ask before writing anything to the PRD. The reviewer is barred from committing,
  from changing task status, and from any command that rewrites analysis or PRD
  state concurrently with the run.
  
  **A broken review never fails a valid task.** By the time the pass runs, the
  task's own completion validation has already passed, so a reviewer that dies,
  writes nothing, or writes something unparseable tells us nothing about the work
  — the failure is reported and the run continues. The distinction is preserved
  on the run record (`run.review`) rather than left in terminal scrollback,
  because a review that silently did not happen must not read as one that found
  nothing. Report transport is a JSON file under `.hench/reviews/<run-id>.json`,
  keyed by run so a re-review keeps both, and cleared before each pass so a stale
  report can never be read as the current one. Unknown enum values in a report
  are coerced toward alarm — an unrecognized severity becomes `critical`, an
  unrecognized action becomes `failed` — so a garbled field demands attention
  instead of reading as clean.
  
  The pass requires the CLI provider and errors out on `provider=api` rather than
  accepting the flag and doing nothing. Its token usage is charged to the run it
  reviewed, so `ndx usage` reflects what `--review` actually costs.

- [#343](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/343) [`e02a5fe`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/e02a5fee539a091a456a17994fa5e8d0ba491558) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - `hench record --no-tokens` now burns the suppressed spend instead of deferring it to the next record.
  
  The `--no-tokens` branch returned before the transcript was read, so the session watermark never advanced: in one session, `record --task=A --no-tokens` followed by a normal `record --task=B` silently rolled A's entire spend into B's record and B's PRD-item rollup. The flag's plain reading — and the existing precedent of the explicit `--*-tokens` path, which advances the watermark because "that spend is now accounted for" — is that suppressed spend is attributed to nothing.
  
  Now the transcript is still read under `--no-tokens` and the watermark advances past the suppressed messages; the record keeps its zeros and its note says how many messages were discarded. A transcript problem never fails a `--no-tokens` record (the caller asked for no usage at all), and `hench record --help` states the discard semantics.

- [#332](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/332) [`b6be7f7`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/b6be7f7f80232fe9b1b45479040db6f81bf6bbce) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - A run file that cannot be read is no longer treated as a run file that changed.
  
  Both change detectors trust mtime only once it is older than the filesystem's timestamp granularity, and inside that window compare a hash of the bytes instead. `hashFile` returns null when the read fails, and both docblocks promised the caller treats that as "no usable hash" rather than as a change. Neither caller did: the comparison guarded the *previous* hash against null but not the new one, so a previously-hashed file whose read now failed compared `"abc" !== null` and was reported modified.
  
  In the web aggregator that was the expensive direction to get wrong. "Modified" means subtract-then-re-read, and when the re-read failed too the contribution was dropped outright — so a momentarily unreadable run file silently lost its tokens from the per-task aggregate until something else touched it. Absence of evidence became a deletion. The hench detector only reports the change without mutating an accumulator, so the cost there was a spurious change flag.
  
  Both now require *both* hashes to be usable before a difference counts. mtime and size already agree at that point, so nothing suggests a rewrite — only that this scan could not check, which is not the same thing. Each side gained a test that injects the read failure (reproducing it from the filesystem is platform-specific; the branch is not) and asserts the file's tokens survive it, with a precondition check so it cannot pass vacuously when no hash was being carried.
  
  Fixed in both copies together, as the twins' shared rule requires. Note for anyone tracing this: there is no parity test between these two detectors and there was never meant to be — `incremental-task-usage.ts` explains why they are deliberately unshared and unpaired, unlike the `quoteWindowsToken` twins.

- [#343](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/343) [`e02a5fe`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/e02a5fee539a091a456a17994fa5e8d0ba491558) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - `hench record` no longer silently claims a whole session when its usage window is missing or malformed.
  
  `--startedAt` doubles as the usage window: the earliest spend a record may claim. Two paths quietly widened that window to the entire transcript. An unparseable value — `--startedAt=25/08/2026`, the shape a locale-formatted `Get-Date` produces — was accepted and discarded, taking the same branch as no window at all. And omitting the flag on a session's first record (the CLI help's own first example) claimed every usage-bearing message the session had, with the total reported as plain fact; measured while building the feature, that was 549 messages and 127M cache-read tokens attributed to one PRD item.
  
  Now an unparseable `--startedAt`/`--since` is a hard error naming the flag — the precedent `--turns=abc` already set — instead of an accepted no-op. A genuinely windowless first record still writes (recording a whole session is legitimate when the whole session was the task), but warns first, naming the message count it is about to claim and pointing at `--startedAt`. `hench record --help` states both behaviors, and its first example now passes `--startedAt`.
  
  The one behavior change to scripts: a sloppy timestamp that used to be ignored now fails the command. That is the point — the silent path put wrong numbers in `get_token_usage` and `ndx usage` with nothing marking them suspicious.

Both fields are additive on the v1 schema — existing run files without them still parse. `hench show`/`status` and the run-complete summary surface the actor.

- [#339](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/339) [`a1ab6cc`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/a1ab6cc90d5ae171fddcc623c670a1e1c0df2a12) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Update LLM model catalogs to current vendor releases
  
  Refreshes the Claude, Codex, and Gemini model catalogs and fixes several
  incorrect context-window and pricing entries. Two of the previous defaults
  pointed at models that are no longer usable.
  
  **Claude**
  - `claude-opus-4-8` → `claude-opus-5` in the init catalog, the `opus` shorthand
    alias, and the `heavy` tier (was `claude-opus-4-7`).
  - Added a `fable` shorthand alias for `claude-fable-5`.
  - Corrected context windows: `claude-sonnet-4-6` and `claude-opus-4-7` are 1M
    models, not 200K.
  - Corrected pricing: `claude-haiku-4-5` is $1.00/$5.00 (was $0.80/$4.00) and
    `claude-opus-4-7` is $5.00/$25.00 (was $15.00/$75.00).
  - Default remains `claude-sonnet-5`.
  
  **Codex** — GPT-5.6 replaces the GPT-5.4/5.5 line
  - Default is now `gpt-5.6-terra` (was `gpt-5.5`), with `gpt-5.6-sol` as a new
    `heavy` tier (codex previously had no tier above standard) and `gpt-5.6-luna`
    as `light` (was `gpt-5.4-mini`).
  - `gpt-5.4` and `gpt-5.4-mini` retire from ChatGPT-authenticated Codex sessions
    on 2026-08-31; `gpt-5.3-codex` and `gpt-5.2` are already unavailable there.
    All four are now legacy aliases that normalize to OpenAI's stated
    replacements, so existing `.n-dx.json` files keep working after upgrade.
  - `gpt-5.5` is still supported and remains a selectable catalog entry.
  - `openai-api-provider` default was `gpt-4o`; now `gpt-5.6-terra`.
  
  **Google**
  - `gemini-2.0-flash` has been **shut down** by Google and was the configured
    `light` tier — replaced with `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`. `standard` moves from
    `gemini-2.5-flash` to `gemini-3.7-flash`.
  - `heavy` intentionally stays on `gemini-2.5-pro`, the newest *stable* Pro
    model. `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` is newer but is a preview release whose ID
    may be renamed or withdrawn; it remains selectable via `llm.google.model`.
  - Corrected `gemini-2.5-flash` pricing to $0.30/$2.50 (was $0.15/$0.60).
  
  Also refreshes the dashboard's model suggestions, which still listed retired
  IDs (`claude-haiku-3-5`, `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`, `o3`, `o4-mini`), and
  updates model examples in `ndx config --help`, `ndx init --help`, and the
  configuration guide.

- [#331](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/331) [`cfdd3b5`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/cfdd3b5d3f53ad7e6a032fa855ba66a359818be9) Thanks [@jeremylumanbailey](https://github.com/jeremylumanbailey)! - Add `--verbose`/`--debug` live progress across `ndx init` and `sourcevision analyze`, and replace scattered vendor string literals with shared `LLM_VENDOR` constants.
  
  **Live progress instrumentation.** `ndx init` gave no visibility into a slow `sourcevision analyze` run — `--debug` reached the child process but its output was fully captured and discarded on success, so a slow run was indistinguishable from a hung one. `ndx init`'s spinner now forwards the child's own progress live (throttled so a high-volume `--debug` firehose can't stall the pipe via backpressure), and the Components phase (component parsing, route detection, server-route detection) gets per-operation timestamped tracing plus automatic gap detection that flags any silence past 250ms by naming the last known checkpoint. A worker-thread-backed live stopwatch prints an incrementing "current operation runtime" for any operation still in flight — verified to keep ticking even during a fully synchronous, non-yielding block, which a same-thread timer cannot do. `hench`'s shell tool gets equivalent live-tail output for long-running commands.
  
  **Fixed a real infinite loop this instrumentation surfaced.** `inferPrefix` (server-route prefix inference) could spin forever on any two ordinary routes that share no deeper common path (e.g. `/users/:id` and `/orders`) — confirmed live via a CPU sample showing 100% of time in `String.prototype.lastIndexOf`. Also tightens `isLikelyRouteFile` so a client-side `api/` directory (axios/fetch-style callers, not Express-style route definitions) is no longer scanned for server routes at all, and adds a length guard against any future misextracted route "path" that's actually an unrelated string literal.
  
  **Vendor literal consolidation.** Replaces hardcoded `"claude"`/`"codex"`/`"google"`/`"local"` string comparisons throughout `core`, `hench`, `rex`, `sourcevision`, and `web` with the canonical `LLM_VENDOR`/`DEFAULT_LLM_VENDOR`/`LLM_VENDORS`/`isLLMVendor` helpers exported from `provider-interface.ts` and re-exported through each package's llm-client gateway, so the supported-vendor set has one source of truth instead of being duplicated ad hoc at each call site.
  
  **Fixed `ndx config <key>` incorrectly reporting an initialized project as stale.** The pre-dispatch directory resolver used for the staleness check and command-timeout config load treated a config key like `llm` as a target directory when no explicit directory argument was given, so `ndx config llm` looked for `.sourcevision`/`.rex`/`.hench` under a nonexistent `llm/` subdirectory and reported a fully-initialized project as uninitialized.

- [#332](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/332) [`b6be7f7`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/b6be7f7f80232fe9b1b45479040db6f81bf6bbce) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Review follow-ups on session usage recording and the adversarial-review skill.
  
  - **The usage watermark can no longer rewind.** When the newest scanned transcript entry carried no `uuid`, the cursor kept the previous `lastUuid` while `consumed` advanced past it — and `lastUuid` wins on the next read, so everything between the two was claimed twice. The uuid watermark is now dropped when the tail has none, so the count governs and nothing is re-claimed. Latent rather than live (real transcripts stamp a uuid on every usage-bearing entry), but `uuid` is typed optional and the input is untrusted JSON parsed line-by-line, and the failure mode was silent inflation of exactly the number this module exists to make trustworthy.
  - **`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is honoured when locating the transcript.** `resolveTranscriptPath` accepted a `configDir` option but nothing outside its own test passed one, so a user who relocated their Claude config tree silently recorded zero tokens. The environment variable is now consulted between the explicit option and the `~/.claude` default.
  - **Transcript discovery probes with `stat` instead of a full read.** The existence probe read the whole file and threw the bytes away; the caller then read it again — twice the I/O on transcripts that reach tens of MB.
  - **`ndx-adversarial-review` stages only what it wrote.** Its commit step inherited the house `git add -A`, but this skill's diff mode takes the dirty working tree as its review subject, so unscoped staging swept the user's in-progress work into a commit attributed to the review. It now runs `git add .rex/prd_tree/` and scopes its porcelain check the same way; the other committing skills, which never take a dirty tree as input, keep `git add -A`.

### Patch Changes

- [#329](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/329) [`b0efffd`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/b0efffdd35449d1e70e2ecd0df8a058aeb2c79ff) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Make a command timeout actually stop the command, descendants included.
  
  `exec` delegated its timeout to Node's `execFile`, which signals only the process it spawned. Anything that process had itself started survived — kept running, kept holding file handles, kept writing to the workspace — while the caller had already been told the command stopped. Measured on Windows with a 400ms timeout: the reported result was `Command timed out after 400ms`, yet the surviving process went on to write four more times, and a temp directory it held could not be removed for 52 seconds.
  
  That report is what an autonomous agent acts on. It reads files and runs the next command believing the previous one finished, so a build or codemod still writing underneath it can corrupt the state being read.
  
  `exec` now owns the timeout timer and terminates the whole process tree when it fires: a process-group signal on POSIX (`SIGTERM`, escalating to `SIGKILL`, waiting on the *group* rather than the direct child), and `taskkill /T /F` on Windows. `exitCode: null` still signals a timeout, and an externally-killed child still reports the same way it always did. Opt out with `treeKill: false` when a child must stay in the caller's own process group.
  
  Not a Windows-only fix, though Windows is where it was caught: the orphan survived on POSIX too, just invisibly, because unlinking open files is permitted there so no EBUSY drew attention to it. On Windows, libuv's global job object masks the problem for node-spawned node, but not for the cases that matter — `sh`, `cmd`, `make`, and pnpm/npm shims all leave their children behind.
  
  The primitive is exported as `terminateProcessTree` / `treeKillSpawnOptions`. It is a deliberate twin of `terminateTree` in `packages/core/child-lifecycle.js`, since the orchestration tier must not import from packages; a parity test fails if the two diverge.

- [#298](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/298) [`1031719`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/1031719e295722833e2982c720e93ff56a929fad) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Detect authentication/session loss before it cascades. `@n-dx/llm-client` now exports `isAuthError(message)`, a shared predicate that recognizes both API auth failures (401/403, rejected/invalid keys, `unauthorized`) and CLI session loss (`not logged in`, `please run … login`, `/login`, expired/revoked sessions or OAuth tokens, `re-authenticate`). `classifyLLMError` uses it, so lost-session messages are now classified as `auth` with re-authentication guidance. In hench's CLI run-loop, `processErrorResult` checks for auth errors *before* the transient-retry check: auth loss is never transient, so the run now fails immediately with actionable re-auth guidance (and a distinct `auth_error` log event) instead of burning retries on a failure the user must fix.

- [#317](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/317) [`68616e5`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/68616e550d0b062cee6add7e18df69a65164dd92) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Enforce the git-subcommand allowlist in CLI provider mode. Previously only the
  API-provider agent loop honored `guard.allowedGitSubcommands`; CLI-mode spawns
  were granted a blanket `Bash(git:*)`, which auto-approved destructive
  subcommands (`reset`, `clean`, `revert`, `push`). The Claude CLI adapter now
  grants `git` at subcommand granularity (`Bash(git commit:*)`, …) drawn from the
  guard allowlist, so destructive subcommands fall through to a permission prompt
  (denied under a non-interactive `acceptEdits` spawn). Codex remains
  sandbox-gated (no per-command allowlist). When no allowlist is present, `git`
  keeps its legacy unscoped grant.

- [#328](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/328) [`615cead`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/615ceadaa1ac6ea261b143d0a5c3a2d4881b17f4) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Agent prompts and task briefs now reference the project's resolved CLI command name (cli.name from .n-dx.json, default "n-dx") instead of hardcoding it — system prompt Project Info names the CLI, the brief's Project section carries it, and task-selection error suggestions use it.

- [#298](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/298) [`1031719`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/1031719e295722833e2982c720e93ff56a929fad) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Deliver the Codex agent prompt via stdin instead of as a positional argv argument. The Codex CLI adapter previously passed the entire `SYSTEM:`/`TASK:` prompt (bounded at 400 KB) as the last `codex exec` argument, which exceeds the OS `ARG_MAX` for a single argv element and crashed real task briefs with `E2BIG` — a primary reason Codex runs were unusable. The adapter now appends `-` and writes the prompt to stdin, matching the Claude adapter and the `@n-dx/llm-client` Codex provider.

- [#298](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/298) [`1031719`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/1031719e295722833e2982c720e93ff56a929fad) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Make Codex quota/token reporting behave sanely under `codex login` (session auth). The quota path required `OPENAI_API_KEY` and matched usage by exact model id, which broke the primary Codex auth flow — session auth never sets an API key (the CLI provider even deletes it), so quota was silently skipped and token retrieval returned not-found for real accounts.
  
  - **Session-auth quota notice:** when Codex is the active vendor and no API key is present, `checkQuotaRemaining` now surfaces a clear `quota unavailable — codex login (session auth) — set OPENAI_API_KEY or llm.codex.api_key for quota` entry instead of silently emitting nothing. `QuotaRemaining` gains an optional `notice` field rendered by `formatQuotaLog`.
  - **Dated deployment ids:** Codex token retrieval now matches the OpenAI usage `model` field tolerantly (`modelMatches`/`stripModelDateSuffix`), so dated deployment ids such as `gpt-5-codex-2025-03-01` resolve to the configured base id `gpt-5-codex`. Matching uses equality after date-stripping, so prefix-sharing models (`gpt-4o` vs `gpt-4o-mini`) never collide.

- [#298](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/298) [`1031719`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/1031719e295722833e2982c720e93ff56a929fad) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Wire Codex text-format token accounting into the event-pipeline close path. When `config.useEventPipeline` was enabled, the two non-JSON `catch` blocks in `spawnWithAdapter`'s close handler were empty, unlike the legacy path which falls back to `parseCodexCliTokenUsage`. Because `codex --json` emits JSONL, `JSON.parse(fullStdout)` always throws, so enabling the event pipeline silently zeroed Codex token/credit accounting. Both catch blocks now recover token usage from the text-format summary line and push a `token_usage` event into the accumulator.

- [#316](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/316) [`c5fdbed`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/c5fdbed684ee91e1b6ceeb77b64bbb3f12b98600) Thanks [@stevemikedan](https://github.com/stevemikedan)! - fix(hench): commit task-completion metadata on the autoCommit path, and stop dropping `fullTestCommand` from config ([#302](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/issues/302))
  
  On the `autoCommit` path the agent commits its own code mid-run and `performCommitPromptIfNeeded` is a no-op, so the completion/resolution metadata written to `.rex/prd_tree` by `updateCompletedTaskStatus` was never committed — it orphaned in the working tree and tripped the next run's pre-run commit gate. `finalizeRun` now calls a focused `commitCompletionMetadata` helper (autoCommit + completed only) that stages `.rex/prd_tree` and commits it in a small dedicated second commit, leaving a clean tree. The non-autoCommit path is unchanged (it already stages PRD files alongside the code), guarded by a staged-diff check so no spurious second commit is created.
  
  Separately, `HenchConfigSchema` was missing `fullTestCommand`, so Zod stripped the key on parse and `loadConfig` returned it as `undefined` — the full-suite test gate always fell back to auto-detect even when `.hench/config.json` set the command. The field is now declared in the schema.

- [#279](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/279) [`18b36f7`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/18b36f73c0b18bdf508b956e3fb42e5bbf5aeabd) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Add a pre-run commit gate to `hench run` / `ndx work`. Once per invocation (before the work loop begins, not per iteration), if the working tree has pre-existing uncommitted changes and the session is interactive, hench shows the diff stat plus an LLM-proposed commit message and prompts to **commit** (stage + commit with the standard N-DX trailers, then proceed), **stop** (abort before running), or **proceed** (start with changes left uncommitted). This keeps a user's in-progress edits from being folded into hench's own commits.
  
  Autonomous runs (`--auto`/`--loop`/`--epic-by-epic`) can't prompt without stalling an unattended loop, so a dirty working tree makes them **abort by default** rather than silently absorb the pre-existing changes. Pass the new `--allow-dirty` flag to start an autonomous run against a dirty tree anyway. Clean trees, `--yes` runs, and other non-interactive sessions proceed without prompting as before.

- [#317](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/317) [`68616e5`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/68616e550d0b062cee6add7e18df69a65164dd92) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Make the hench pre-run commit gate size-aware with configurable thresholds.
  
  The gate now measures change magnitude (dirty file count plus lines changed vs HEAD via `git diff --numstat`, shared helper `measureChangeMagnitude`) instead of reacting only to a non-empty dirty list. Two new persisted settings under `hench.git.*` (`.hench/config.json`, editable via `ndx config`):
  
  - **`hench.git.checkpointThreshold`** (default: 200, 0 disables) — at/above this many changed lines, the interactive prompt warns about the change size and defaults to committing a checkpoint instead of proceeding. Below the threshold, behavior is unchanged.
  - **`hench.git.requireCleanTree`** (default: false) — refuse to start against a dirty tree: the interactive prompt drops the "proceed" option and non-interactive runs (`--yes`, piped) abort.
  
  Autonomous runs (`--auto`/`--loop`/`--epic-by-epic`) keep today's behavior — abort on any dirty tree unless `--allow-dirty` — but the refusal now reports the measured magnitude. `--allow-dirty` takes precedence over both config settings for a single run (flag > config > defaults). Documented in `hench run --help` and `ndx config --help`.

- [#316](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/316) [`c5fdbed`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/c5fdbed684ee91e1b6ceeb77b64bbb3f12b98600) Thanks [@stevemikedan](https://github.com/stevemikedan)! - fix(hench): make parent auto-completion self-healing so cascades are no longer silently lost ([#293](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/issues/293))
  
  During `hench run --auto --loop`, a child task could be persisted as `completed` while the parent auto-completion cascade was silently dropped — leaving parent features stuck `pending` with every child done, and no reconciliation path to recover. The cause: in `toolRexUpdateStatus` the `status_updated` log append and the cascade shared the caller's single best-effort `try/catch`, so a log-append failure after the child's status write cancelled the cascade; and the cascade was event-driven (`findAutoCompletions` walks only the triggering item's ancestor chain), so a missed cascade was never retried.
  
  Two changes:
  
  - **rex:** add `reconcileAutoCompletions(items)` — a whole-tree, bottom-up sweep that completes every parent whose children are all terminal (`completed`/`deferred`), independent of any single trigger item. It self-heals parents whose earlier cascade was lost. Exported from `public.ts`.
  - **hench:** in `toolRexUpdateStatus`, wrap the `status_updated` append in its own try/catch so a log failure can no longer cancel the cascade, and drive the cascade with `reconcileAutoCompletions` (via `rex-gateway`) for whole-tree healing. Cascade failures in `updateCompletedTaskStatus` and the finalize path are now recorded in `run.diagnostics.notes` instead of a console-only warning.

- [#317](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/317) [`68616e5`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/68616e550d0b062cee6add7e18df69a65164dd92) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Make the `rollbackOnFailure` revert **prompt-only** — a failed run never discards work without an express, per-run confirmation. On an interactive TTY, a failed run prompts `Revert N uncommitted file(s)? [y/N]` (defaults to **No**); only an explicit yes reverts — and even then the revert stays scoped ([#303](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/issues/303)): tracked changes are reverted via `git reset`/`checkout`, but untracked removal is limited to files the agent created this run (diffed against the pre-run baseline); pre-existing untracked work is never deleted. Declining preserves the working tree.
  
  Non-interactive runs — autonomous (`--auto`/`--loop`/`--epic-by-epic`), `--yes`, and non-TTY/CI — have no channel for a per-run confirmation, so they **never** revert on failure: the working tree is left exactly as-is and the uncommitted files are reported. This replaces the previous unattended auto-revert. `--no-rollback` / `hench.rollbackOnFailure: false` still suppresses the prompt entirely. PRD status reset on failure is unchanged.

- [#329](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/329) [`b0efffd`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/b0efffdd35449d1e70e2ecd0df8a058aeb2c79ff) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Stop `RunChangeDetector` from missing a same-length run-file rewrite.
  
  It decided whether a run file had changed by comparing mtime + size, which misses a whole class of edit on Windows: file timestamps advance in ticks, so a rewrite of the same LENGTH inside one tick leaves both values identical. Measured on NTFS — 163 of 200 back-to-back same-size rewrites produced a byte-identical `mtimeMs`, with gaps between consecutive distinct mtimes running up to 10ms. An equal-length edit to a run record (a taskId or status swap) therefore kept its stale contribution until some later change forced a re-read. ext4 records nanoseconds, which is why Linux never showed it.
  
  mtime is now trusted only once it is older than a granularity bound. Inside that window the snapshot also carries a hash of the file's bytes and detection compares that; the hash is dropped as soon as the mtime ages out, so the steady state stays stat-only. The two new checkpoint fields are optional, so a checkpoint written by an earlier version still loads — its mtime is old by definition, so the absence of a hash correctly means "trustworthy".
  
  This is the same defect fixed in web's `IncrementalTaskUsageAggregator`. The two implementations are deliberately kept as documented twins rather than sharing a helper: no module both packages can import is an appropriate home for a filesystem utility, and — unlike the `quoteWindowsToken` twin — these two never need to agree with each other, so there is nothing for a parity test to assert. Each side carries its own `utimes`-pinned test for the hazard instead.

- [#316](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/316) [`c5fdbed`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/c5fdbed684ee91e1b6ceeb77b64bbb3f12b98600) Thanks [@stevemikedan](https://github.com/stevemikedan)! - fix(hench): scope failure rollback to agent-created files and honor `--no-rollback` on review rejection ([#303](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/issues/303))
  
  Rollback on run failure previously ran a blanket `git clean -fd`, deleting **every** untracked file in the working tree — including the user's pre-existing scratch, `.env`, and other hidden files that git had never tracked and could not recover. It also reverted unconditionally when a reviewer rejected changes, ignoring the `--no-rollback` flag entirely.
  
  `revertChanges` now captures a baseline of untracked files before the agent runs (`captureBaselineUntracked`, mirroring `captureStartingHead`) and removes **only** the untracked files the agent created during that run, via a scoped `git clean -fd -- <paths>`. Pre-existing untracked files are never touched. When no baseline is available it deletes nothing (safe fallback). Tracked-file changes are still reverted via `git reset` + `git checkout` (recoverable from history). The review-rejection path now honors `rollbackOnFailure`/`--no-rollback` and reuses the same interactive confirmation prompt as the failure path. The baseline is threaded through both the API/Gemini (`loop.ts`) and CLI (`cli-loop.ts`) run loops.

Removed the dead `gpt-5.4mini` legacy alias from `LEGACY_CODEX_MODEL_ALIASES` (its target `gpt-5.4-mini` is already a direct catalog model and the non-hyphen key was never a shipped ID). The remaining legacy brand IDs (`gpt-5-codex`, `gpt-5.1-codex-max`, `gpt-5.1-codex-mini`) now match the orchestration-tier list in `init-llm.js`, with cross-reference comments pinning the two tiers together. Updated the hench vendor-compatibility error hint from the outdated `gpt-4o, o1` to current Codex models (`gpt-5.5, gpt-5.4-mini`).

The dashboard can now run and observe the full n-dx flow: self-heal with live iteration/phase progress and a stop control, full sourcevision analysis with async progress, rex fix/reshape/CI actions with dry-run previews, a Commands reference with inline run triggers, and views for the previously UI-less requirements, adaptive-optimization, and activity-log APIs.

Resolves all 45 `pnpm audit` findings (2 critical, 16 high) via updated direct dependencies and refreshed pnpm overrides (hono, @hono/node-server, fast-uri, ip-address, js-yaml, nanoid, postcss, qs, vite, ws, body-parser). Modernizes major tooling: TypeScript 6.0, vitest 4.1.10, ink 7, ora 9, jsdom 30, esbuild 0.28, @modelcontextprotocol/sdk 1.30, @anthropic-ai/sdk 0.117, changesets 3. Raises the supported Node.js floor from 18 to 22 (Node 18 and 20 are both end-of-life; CI already runs Node 22).

- [#299](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/299) [`ab24172`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/ab241723f3822cca76e801d4628289b3c45b0b84) Thanks [@stevemikedan](https://github.com/stevemikedan)! - Harden CLI spawning on Windows so launching `.cmd` shims (claude, codex, rex) no longer fails. Node can't spawn a `.cmd` directly (post-CVE-2024-27980), and the previous `shell: process.platform === "win32"` workaround triggered the `[DEP0190]` deprecation and broke on paths containing spaces.
  
  - **New `spawnCli` helper** (`@n-dx/llm-client`) routes CLI binaries through `cmd.exe /d /s /c` with `windowsVerbatimArguments` and never uses `shell:true`. Argument quoting follows the Microsoft ArgvQuote / cross-spawn rules (unconditional quoting, backslash-run doubling before quotes, embedded-quote doubling) so paths with spaces and tokens with cmd.exe metacharacters (`& | < > ^ ( )`) are handled. The orchestration tier (`@n-dx/core`) carries an equivalent `win-spawn.js` twin (it cannot import `@n-dx/llm-client`), kept in lockstep by a cross-package parity test.
  - **All CLI-binary spawn sites** are routed through the helper: the claude and codex providers, the hench agent loop and its adapters, the `ndx config` CLI-path validator, `ndx pair-programming`'s reviewer, and sourcevision's `rex` invocations.
  - **Prompts are delivered via stdin** for the codex hench adapter and the pair-programming reviewer (previously passed as an argv token), preventing multi-line prompt truncation and command injection through `cmd.exe`.
  - **`diagnoseCliInvocation`** produces an actionable message when a CLI binary is missing or not invokable — distinguishing a not-found binary, a configured absolute path that doesn't exist, and a binary present on PATH but failing to run — and works from the close/non-zero-exit path on Windows (where a missing `.cmd` never raises `ENOENT`). Detection is anchored to the spawned binary so a legitimate run's own error output isn't misclassified.
  - A **regression guard test** fails CI if any CLI spawn site reintroduces the `shell:true` + args (`DEP0190`) pattern.
  
  No behavior change on macOS or Linux.

The `/ndx-work` skill drove tasks through Claude Code without spawning hench, so the work left no `.hench/runs/` entry and was invisible to run history and `ndx usage`. A new `hench record` command writes a lightweight run record (task id, title, status, summary, timestamps, model) marked `assisted`, and the skill now calls it as a final step. Because Claude Code does not expose its own token consumption to a running skill, assisted records carry empty token usage and an `assisted` flag so analytics can distinguish them from genuine hench runs rather than reading them as anomalies; the skill also surfaces this caveat to the user.

  - Detect Swift projects (`Package.swift`, `*.xcodeproj`, `*.xcworkspace`) and
    apply a Swift guard profile: `allowedCommands: ["swift", "make",
"xcodebuild", "xcrun", "git"]`, Swift-aware blocked paths
    (`.build/`, `DerivedData/`, `Pods/`, `Carthage/`), and longer timeouts to
    fit Xcode build times. Adds `"swift"` to `ProjectLanguage`.
  - `autoDetectTestCommand` now prefers a Makefile `validate` target over the
    raw language toolchain — a strong "project author wrapped the full gate
    here" signal — and falls back to per-language defaults for Swift (`swift
test`), Cargo (`cargo test`), Go (`go test ./...`), and Python (`pytest`)
    before giving up.

  Net effect: on a Swift codebase with a `make validate` gate, `ndx init`
  yields a usable `.hench/config.json` with the right toolchain allowed AND
  the resolver picks up `make validate` automatically — no manual
  `hench.fullTestCommand` override needed.

  **PRD context graph (web)** — Top-down progressive-disclosure layout with folder-tree
  visual style; shape-based nodes for epic/feature/task/subtask; click-through opens the
  Rex task detail panel with subtree highlighting. Hierarchy is now driven from
  `.rex/prd_tree/` paths.

  **Hench run loop** — Per-task attempt tracking, completed tasks excluded from
  selection, and the loop advances immediately on success. The `no-plan-mode` rule is
  embedded in the agent system prompt; autonomous runs (`--auto` / `--loop` /
  `--epic-by-epic`) default to `acceptEdits`. New
  `docs/contributing/run-loop-invariants.md`.

  **LLM auto-failover** — New `llm.autoFailover` flag with vendor-specific failover
  chains; `hench run` restores the original config after a failover attempt. Model
  resolution honours top-level `llm.model` → `llm.{vendor}.model` → tier default.

  **Rex storage** — PRD tree rewritten to canonical `index.md`-per-folder layout with
  single-child compaction and atomic leaf-to-folder promotion for subtasks. Timestamped
  snapshots before structural migrations; cross-PRD duplicate detection in `reshape`.

  **CLI / DX** — New `ndx tree` command and tree-formatted `rex status`; `ndx self-heal`
  gains a pre-execution approval gate with `selfHeal.autoConfirm`. Obfuscated-code commit
  blocker added.

  **Security** — clears 27 of 30 Dependabot advisories:

  - `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` ^1.25.3 → ^1.29.0 (rex, sourcevision, web) — fixes cross-client data leak via shared transport reuse (GHSA-345p-7cg4-v4c7) plus transitive `hono`, `@hono/node-server`, `path-to-regexp`, `ajv`, and `qs` advisories.
  - `@anthropic-ai/sdk` ^0.85.0 → ^0.94.0 (hench, llm-client) — fixes insecure default file permissions in the local-filesystem memory tool (GHSA-p7fg-763f-g4gf).
  - `vitest` ^4.0.18 → ^4.1.5 (root) — fixes transitive `vite` and `picomatch` advisories.
  - Adds range-scoped `pnpm.overrides` for `picomatch`, `postcss`, `hono`, `@hono/node-server`, `ajv`, `path-to-regexp`, `qs`, and `vite` to pin patched versions in transitive trees the resolver would otherwise leave on older cached versions.

  Audit drops from 11 high / 21 moderate / 2 low to 1 high / 2 moderate. The remaining advisories (rollup, esbuild, vite reached via `vitepress`) are dev-server-only docs-build vulns deferred to a follow-up.

  **Packaging regression guard** — moves `assistant-assets/` under `packages/core/` so it ships inside the published `@n-dx/core` tarball, and adds two e2e tests to prevent recurrence:

  - `tests/e2e/published-assets-bundled.test.js` — asserts `pnpm pack` includes the assistant-assets payload.
  - `tests/e2e/published-package-loadability.test.js` — installs each packed tarball into a clean fixture and verifies CLIs load.

  **Docs** — README, getting-started, and quickstart updates with screenshots in `documentation/` to walk through `ndx init`, `analyze`, `plan`, `work`, `status`, `start`, `ci`, and `self-heal`.

### Patch Changes

- [#167](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/167) [`9ce5ee5`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/9ce5ee50f9c2a8f90099f2a0fed17475441d55c7) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - more documentation additions and sourcevision token optimizations

- [#168](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/168) [`04c8310`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/04c8310e0ea15eb329b4839b71518d015f5f755f) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Vendor-aware batch construction and response handling in self-heal

  - **`llm-client`**: Add `VENDOR_CONTEXT_CHAR_LIMITS` — per-vendor safe prompt size constants (claude: 640K chars, codex: 400K chars) derived from each vendor's context window.
  - **`hench/summary.ts`**: Recognise Codex CLI tool names (`shell`, `str_replace_editor`, `create_file`) in `buildRunSummary`. Fixes IC-1: file-change tracking now works for Codex runs.
  - **`hench/cli-loop.ts`**: Bound the brief text to `VENDOR_CONTEXT_CHAR_LIMITS[vendor]` before each dispatch. Uses the vendor/model resolver from `llm-gateway` rather than a Claude-specific constant.
  - **`hench/shared.ts`**: When `toolCalls` is empty in self-heal mode, fall back to `git diff --name-only HEAD` to populate `filesChanged`. Fixes IC-2: the mandatory test gate now runs for Codex (which does not emit structured tool events).
