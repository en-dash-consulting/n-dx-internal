/**
 * Commit message file watcher with auto-commit timer.
 *
 * When the agent writes `.hench-commit-msg.txt` during a run, this module
 * detects the write and arms a one-shot timer. On timer expiry the file is
 * read: if it has non-empty content the staged changes are committed and the
 * file is removed; if the file is empty or whitespace-only it is deleted
 * without committing and a distinct log line is emitted. This handles the
 * case where the run terminates abnormally (timeout, crash) after the agent
 * staged its work but before n-dx could process the commit prompt.
 *
 * Call `cancel()` to disarm both the watcher and any pending timer — the normal
 * run lifecycle always cancels before calling `performCommitPromptIfNeeded` so
 * the two mechanisms cannot double-commit.
 *
