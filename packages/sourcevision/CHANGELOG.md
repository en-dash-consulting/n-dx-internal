### Patch Changes

- [#351](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/351) [`d21d0ab`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/d21d0ab9d291fe444726d038415d8cddd5fc8e8e) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Discover isometric-map infrastructure from CloudFormation and SAM templates, not only Terraform. `.yaml`/`.yml` files are scanned for a top-level `Resources:` block plus a namespaced `Type:` — strict enough that a CI workflow or a k8s manifest is never mistaken for infrastructure — and resource types are normalised (`AWS::SQS::Queue` → `aws_sqs_queue`) so both dialects share the one classification table instead of each carrying its own. Name literals come from `BucketName`/`QueueName`/… properties but never from a `!Ref` or `!Sub`, which is not a name. A project on CloudFormation now gets infrastructure nodes with nothing declared by hand in `.n-dx.json`.

- [#351](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/351) [`d21d0ab`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/d21d0ab9d291fe444726d038415d8cddd5fc8e8e) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Check declared injection seams against the call graph on the isometric map. A seam declared under `sourcevision.isoMap.injectionSeams` was previously drawn on trust, so a refactor could leave the declaration behind and the map would keep asserting a relationship nothing invokes. Where `callgraph.json` is available, each named callback is now looked for on the receiving side: a corroborated seam's panel names the file and expression that matched, a seam the call graph does not support is drawn thinner and fainter with a sparser dash and labelled "unverified", and callbacks nothing calls are listed in the page footer. A view with no call graph reports the seams as unchecked rather than marking them unverified.

- [#354](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/354) [`72609db`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/72609db1c4572f94ef25a2178d5cac2c17e241dc) Thanks [@ryrykeith](https://github.com/ryrykeith)! - Fix `analyze` promoting git worktree checkouts as sub-analyses.
  
  Sub-analysis discovery walked into `.claude/worktrees/<name>/` and other in-repo
  worktrees. Each is a full checkout carrying its own `.sourcevision/`, so every
  live worktree injected a duplicate copy of the parent's zones — one observed run
  returned 120 zones, 87 of them duplicates.
  
  `findSubSvDirs()` now skips `.claude`, and additionally skips any directory that
  `git worktree list --porcelain` reports as a registered worktree nested inside
  the analysis root. Worktree resolution is best-effort: if git is unavailable or
  the directory is not a repository, the scan behaves exactly as before. The root
  itself is never skipped, so analyzing a project that is itself a worktree still
  works.

### Patch Changes

- [#346](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/346) [`4e0ca1c`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/4e0ca1c4c220f58855ade454e72c9500391dd0ec) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Add a distilled repo primer and prefer it over CONTEXT.md as agent startup
  context.
  
  `ndx work` pipes CONTEXT.md plus a PRD excerpt into every task spawn. Even
  capped, that document is written for breadth — zone metrics, findings, route
  tables, import summaries — while a task starting work needs where things live,
  how to build and test, and what the conventions are. It needs that on every
  task and every retry, which is what makes distilling it worth one LLM call.
  
  `sourcevision analyze` now writes `.sourcevision/PRIMER.md`, and the
  orchestrator reads it in preference to CONTEXT.md, falling back silently when
  absent. The distiller lives in sourcevision rather than beside the pipe it
  feeds: orchestration is only allowed to spawn CLIs, and sourcevision already
  owns artifact generation, content-hash caching, and the one `callClaude` choke
  point with task-class routing. A side benefit is that the primer is now an
  artifact any consumer can read.
  
  Everything about it fails soft. The primer is cached against the analysis
  fingerprint, so it is regenerated only when the repository is re-analysed.
  Generation is skipped entirely unless the analysis already made successful LLM
  calls — the vendor and auth-mode getters both fall back to defaults when
  nothing is configured, so consulting them would have this attempt a spawn in
  every environment without a model, including CI. Output shorter than 200 or
  longer than 12,000 characters is rejected rather than truncated, because a
  primer cut mid-sentence would be inherited by every task in the loop while a
  missing one simply falls back to CONTEXT.md.

Blocks listened on both `pointerup` and `click` while selection toggled, so one physical click fired twice and deselected immediately — the map appeared inert. Blocks now listen on `click` only and selection is set rather than toggled. Connectors are also clickable now, with a widened transparent hit target and a panel describing the dependency and both its ends, and the detail panel scrolls into view on narrow layouts where it sits below the map.

- [#350](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/350) [`3bd5f65`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/3bd5f65fe3c41f2f0ae93aac6333f7e0c9480fe8) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - The isometric map can now show the two things an import graph structurally cannot: injection seams and runtime infrastructure.
  
  **Injection seams.** A callback or event seam runs the opposite way at runtime from the import that static analysis sees, so the map used to draw an arrow that was backwards for the behaviour people care about. Seams declared under `sourcevision.isoMap.injectionSeams` in `.n-dx.json` are now drawn in the runtime control-flow direction, in a distinct colour, with a panel listing the injected callbacks and stating plainly that the relationship was declared rather than inferred. `from`/`to` accept a zone id, a file path or a directory prefix.
  
  **Runtime infrastructure.** Queues, buckets, caches and databases have no import signature at all. Terraform `resource` blocks are now scanned and classified, and anything IaC does not cover can be declared under `sourcevision.isoMap.infrastructure`. Both render as a trailing column, attributed to the zones whose source names them — weaker evidence than an import, and the panel says so. Resource types with no architectural meaning (IAM roles, security groups) are skipped, and names too short or too generic to match on are refused.
  
  A declaration that cannot be drawn — both ends inside one zone, or naming a file no zone owns — is reported in the page footer rather than silently dropped.

- [#350](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/350) [`3bd5f65`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/3bd5f65fe3c41f2f0ae93aac6333f7e0c9480fe8) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - Fix two isometric-map defects the new UI smoke test exposed.
  
  `ndx init` writes empty `.sourcevision/` data files before anything has been analyzed, so `hasSourcevision()` was true on a freshly-initialized project and auto mode never fell back to a scan. A project full of source that had not been analyzed yet reported "nothing to map". Auto now falls back when the analysis parses but contains no zones.
  
  `GET /api/iso-map` answered 404 for "this project has nothing to map yet". That is a state of the map, not a missing resource, and a 4xx on a `fetch` writes a network error into the browser console — which `tests/e2e-ui/navigation.spec.ts` requires every view to load without. It now answers 200 with an `x-iso-map-empty` marker header and a readable empty-state page, so the viewer still renders its own empty card and anyone opening the URL directly gets a page rather than a JSON blob. Genuine faults (bad parameter, wrong method, build failure) remain 4xx/5xx.
  
  Also adds the `iso-map` and pre-existing `pr-markdown` views to the navigation smoke test, whose list is meant to track every `ViewId`.

- [#350](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/350) [`3bd5f65`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/3bd5f65fe3c41f2f0ae93aac6333f7e0c9480fe8) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - Iso map: one implementation, several gaps closed.
  
  The standalone skill script is now generated from `packages/sourcevision/src/export/` by `scripts/build-iso-skill.mjs` rather than hand-maintained, so the map has a single source of truth; `tests/e2e/iso-skill-drift.test.js` fails if the committed bundle goes stale, and also executes it. This removed a real divergence where the two copies disagreed on zone colours because one counted archetypes before mapping them to kinds and the other after — kinds are now resolved per file and counted once, which answers "what does this zone do" rather than "what is its most common file type".
  
  Also: the project scanner moved into the package (`iso-scan.ts`) and gained tsconfig `paths`, workspace-package and Go `go.mod` resolution, so a monorepo's own packages stop looking third-party; call-graph data, when present, adds per-edge runtime call counts with a Weight: imports/calls toggle and surfaces call-only edges as injected seams; output is reproducible (timestamps default to the HEAD commit time); key files link to source via the git remote; multi-layer edges route through corridors between rows instead of cutting through blocks; and the page gained a light theme, reduced-motion support, kind glyphs alongside colour, a skip link, and a tab order of one stop per zone instead of one per connector.
  
  New: `ndx iso`, `sourcevision iso --source=scan`, and `GET /api/iso-map` in the web dashboard.

- [#350](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/350) [`3bd5f65`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/3bd5f65fe3c41f2f0ae93aac6333f7e0c9480fe8) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - New opt-in `sourcevision iso` command renders `.sourcevision/iso-map.html`: a standalone, dependency-free isometric map of the codebase. Each architectural zone becomes an extruded 3D block — footprint from file count, height from line count, colour from its dominant archetype — with import relationships drawn as connectors, click-to-inspect detail panels (metrics, insights, findings, key files, cross-zone edges), pan/zoom, and a legend that filters by kind. Never generated by `analyze`.

- [#346](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/346) [`4e0ca1c`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/4e0ca1c4c220f58855ade454e72c9500391dd0ec) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Complete light-tier routing: move classification to the light tier, and give
  the two unguarded light calls real output contracts.
  
  `sourcevision`'s classification batches now resolve through the `code.classify`
  task class. This is the last of the audit's routing-map flips and the safest of
  them: a fixed-size batch goes in, an enum-constrained list comes out, unknown
  paths and unknown archetype ids are already dropped per item, and a prompt
  degradation ladder already handles parse failures — so a wrong answer costs one
  dropped classification.
  
  Routing a call to the cheapest adequate model is only a safe trade while bad
  output stays detectable, and two light-routed calls had nothing checking them.
  
  The commit-subject call feeds `git commit -m` directly, and previously took the
  first non-empty line and sliced it to 100 characters — so a fenced block, a
  "Sure! Here's a subject:" preamble, or a markdown bullet would have been
  committed into the repository's history. It now goes through a contract that
  strips those tics and enforces one line within the documented 72-character
  bound, falling back to the generic message when nothing usable survives:
  refusing to commit would be worse than committing under a generic subject.
  
  The body-merge call was worse — whatever the model returned was written verbatim
  as the surviving PRD item's description, so an empty answer or a JSON blob would
  have been persisted as the item's body. It now validates, and *throws* on
  failure rather than repairing: `reshape` already treats body merge as
  best-effort and keeps the existing description, which beats persisting a
  preamble or a sentence cut in half by a length cap.
  
  The other six light-routed sites were audited and already had contracts — zod
  schemas for renames, clarify rounds and the assessment pass, and proposal
  parsing with count checks for the consolidation guard. A new integration test
  pins the resolved model for every class in the routing map, in both directions:
  the light routes must be light, and the agent loop, proposal generation, and
  deep enrichment must not be.

- [#346](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/346) [`4e0ca1c`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/4e0ca1c4c220f58855ade454e72c9500391dd0ec) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Cap the three sourcevision artifacts that grew without bound with repository
  size.
  
  These files are read by agents, not people, so their size is a token cost paid
  on every run that consumes them — and each of the three had a section that
  scaled with the repository while everything around it was already summarized.
  
  The `llms.txt` file-inventory table is capped at 400 rows; it was the file's
  largest section by far, measured at 75 KB of a 108 KB file. `CONTEXT.md`'s
  routes section is capped at 15 handler groups and 15 routes per group, matching
  the caps already applied to findings and next steps directly below it — it was
  the one section in that file with no bound, at 54% of the file on a route-heavy
  project. The `sourcevision://zones` MCP resource no longer returns the whole of
  zones.json pretty-printed (~80K tokens in one tool result): it now returns the
  cross-zone map — identity, cohesion, coupling, file counts, entry points,
  crossings — as compact JSON, and names the `get_zone` tool for the per-zone
  files and findings it omits.
  
  Every cap states what it dropped, with both the omitted count and the total. A
  silently truncated index is worse than a large one, because a reader cannot
  tell whether a path is absent from the repository or merely unlisted.

- [#345](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/345) [`0c9c31d`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/0c9c31da941fc92ec6ce14e6ed2e3d6c3fcfecae) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Stop git-backed sourcevision tests timing out on Windows CI
  
  `branch-work-collector`, `pr-markdown`, and `pr-markdown-reviewer-output` build
  real git repositories in a temp directory. The heaviest tests spend 8-13
  synchronous `git` spawns each — init/config/commit/checkout in the fixture, plus
  the collector's own `rev-parse` and two speculative `git show` calls. Those run
  in 230-540ms locally, but Windows process creation and on-access scanning of the
  temp worktree pushed three of them past vitest's 5000ms default.
  
  Sourcevision was the last package with git-spawning integration tests still on
  that default, so its `testTimeout` now matches hench and rex at 30s. No
  production code changed.

- [#346](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/346) [`4e0ca1c`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/4e0ca1c4c220f58855ade454e72c9500391dd0ec) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Thread task classes through every package's LLM choke point, and pass the
  routing config surfaces through the `.n-dx.json` loader.
  
  rex's `spawnClaude`/`resolveConfiguredModel` accept `{ taskClass }` alongside
  the legacy bare weight (the class wins; an explicit model still beats both),
  and the analyze call sites now declare their classes — renames, merges,
  consolidation checks, assessment, and clarify rounds route light by registry
  default exactly as before, while proposals, modify, spec synthesis, smart-add,
  and restructuring declare their standard-tier classes. `prd.decompose` is
  deliberately not declared yet: its registry default is light, and that flip is
  gated on the escalation ladder. sourcevision's `callClaude` gains the same
  option, `resolveLightModel` now resolves through `zone.enrich-scan`, and the
  enrichment passes and meta-evaluation declare their classes. hench resolves
  the agent loop via `agent.execute` (standard by default — but
  `llm.routes["agent.execute"] = "heavy"` now reroutes a run with no code
  change), the pre-run commit message via `git.commit-message`, and CLI-path
  run records carry the resolved tier in `weight` instead of always "standard".
  `loadLLMConfig` passes `llm.tiers`, `llm.routes`, `llm.effort`, and
  `llm.escalation` through its whitelist so the new config actually reaches
  runtime. A repo-level contract test walks declared task classes and fails on
  any class missing from `DEFAULT_ROUTES` or any choke point that stops
  declaring its classes.

### Patch Changes

- [#339](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/339) [`a1ab6cc`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/a1ab6cc90d5ae171fddcc623c670a1e1c0df2a12) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Add Gemini support to the dashboard LLM Provider view, and complete the documentation cleanup
  
  The dashboard offered claude / codex / local only, so a project configured with
  `llm.vendor google` could not see or edit its model settings there and
  `llm.google.*` was absent from the config API response. Gemini is now a
  first-class vendor in that view.
  
  Also completes the outstanding documentation findings: removes the removed
  `prd.md` + `prd.json` dual-write architecture from the rex README (including an
  unreplaced `![img_here](img_here)` placeholder that shipped to npm), corrects
  the Node floor to match `engines: >=22`, completes the command references, and
  deletes or archives superseded docs.

- [#339](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/339) [`a1ab6cc`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/a1ab6cc90d5ae171fddcc623c670a1e1c0df2a12) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Update LLM model catalogs to current vendor releases
  
  Refreshes the Claude, Codex, and Gemini model catalogs and fixes several
  incorrect context-window and pricing entries. Two of the previous defaults
  pointed at models that are no longer usable.
  
  **Claude**
  - `claude-opus-4-8` → `claude-opus-5` in the init catalog, the `opus` shorthand
    alias, and the `heavy` tier (was `claude-opus-4-7`).
  - Added a `fable` shorthand alias for `claude-fable-5`.
  - Corrected context windows: `claude-sonnet-4-6` and `claude-opus-4-7` are 1M
    models, not 200K.
  - Corrected pricing: `claude-haiku-4-5` is $1.00/$5.00 (was $0.80/$4.00) and
    `claude-opus-4-7` is $5.00/$25.00 (was $15.00/$75.00).
  - Default remains `claude-sonnet-5`.
  
  **Codex** — GPT-5.6 replaces the GPT-5.4/5.5 line
  - Default is now `gpt-5.6-terra` (was `gpt-5.5`), with `gpt-5.6-sol` as a new
    `heavy` tier (codex previously had no tier above standard) and `gpt-5.6-luna`
    as `light` (was `gpt-5.4-mini`).
  - `gpt-5.4` and `gpt-5.4-mini` retire from ChatGPT-authenticated Codex sessions
    on 2026-08-31; `gpt-5.3-codex` and `gpt-5.2` are already unavailable there.
    All four are now legacy aliases that normalize to OpenAI's stated
    replacements, so existing `.n-dx.json` files keep working after upgrade.
  - `gpt-5.5` is still supported and remains a selectable catalog entry.
  - `openai-api-provider` default was `gpt-4o`; now `gpt-5.6-terra`.
  
  **Google**
  - `gemini-2.0-flash` has been **shut down** by Google and was the configured
    `light` tier — replaced with `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`. `standard` moves from
    `gemini-2.5-flash` to `gemini-3.7-flash`.
  - `heavy` intentionally stays on `gemini-2.5-pro`, the newest *stable* Pro
    model. `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` is newer but is a preview release whose ID
    may be renamed or withdrawn; it remains selectable via `llm.google.model`.
  - Corrected `gemini-2.5-flash` pricing to $0.30/$2.50 (was $0.15/$0.60).
  
  Also refreshes the dashboard's model suggestions, which still listed retired
  IDs (`claude-haiku-3-5`, `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`, `o3`, `o4-mini`), and
  updates model examples in `ndx config --help`, `ndx init --help`, and the
  configuration guide.

- [#331](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/331) [`cfdd3b5`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/cfdd3b5d3f53ad7e6a032fa855ba66a359818be9) Thanks [@jeremylumanbailey](https://github.com/jeremylumanbailey)! - Add `--verbose`/`--debug` live progress across `ndx init` and `sourcevision analyze`, and replace scattered vendor string literals with shared `LLM_VENDOR` constants.
  
  **Live progress instrumentation.** `ndx init` gave no visibility into a slow `sourcevision analyze` run — `--debug` reached the child process but its output was fully captured and discarded on success, so a slow run was indistinguishable from a hung one. `ndx init`'s spinner now forwards the child's own progress live (throttled so a high-volume `--debug` firehose can't stall the pipe via backpressure), and the Components phase (component parsing, route detection, server-route detection) gets per-operation timestamped tracing plus automatic gap detection that flags any silence past 250ms by naming the last known checkpoint. A worker-thread-backed live stopwatch prints an incrementing "current operation runtime" for any operation still in flight — verified to keep ticking even during a fully synchronous, non-yielding block, which a same-thread timer cannot do. `hench`'s shell tool gets equivalent live-tail output for long-running commands.
  
  **Fixed a real infinite loop this instrumentation surfaced.** `inferPrefix` (server-route prefix inference) could spin forever on any two ordinary routes that share no deeper common path (e.g. `/users/:id` and `/orders`) — confirmed live via a CPU sample showing 100% of time in `String.prototype.lastIndexOf`. Also tightens `isLikelyRouteFile` so a client-side `api/` directory (axios/fetch-style callers, not Express-style route definitions) is no longer scanned for server routes at all, and adds a length guard against any future misextracted route "path" that's actually an unrelated string literal.
  
  **Vendor literal consolidation.** Replaces hardcoded `"claude"`/`"codex"`/`"google"`/`"local"` string comparisons throughout `core`, `hench`, `rex`, `sourcevision`, and `web` with the canonical `LLM_VENDOR`/`DEFAULT_LLM_VENDOR`/`LLM_VENDORS`/`isLLMVendor` helpers exported from `provider-interface.ts` and re-exported through each package's llm-client gateway, so the supported-vendor set has one source of truth instead of being duplicated ad hoc at each call site.
  
  **Fixed `ndx config <key>` incorrectly reporting an initialized project as stale.** The pre-dispatch directory resolver used for the staleness check and command-timeout config load treated a config key like `llm` as a target directory when no explicit directory argument was given, so `ndx config llm` looked for `.sourcevision`/`.rex`/`.hench` under a nonexistent `llm/` subdirectory and reported a fully-initialized project as uninitialized.

### Patch Changes

Backed by a new `sourcevision analyze --target-pass=<N>` flag and a `targetPass` option on `POST /api/commands/sv-analyze` (async with status polling, like full runs).

The dashboard can now run and observe the full n-dx flow: self-heal with live iteration/phase progress and a stop control, full sourcevision analysis with async progress, rex fix/reshape/CI actions with dry-run previews, a Commands reference with inline run triggers, and views for the previously UI-less requirements, adaptive-optimization, and activity-log APIs. Command references throughout the dashboard and hench prompts resolve from the project's detected CLI name.

A universal convention heuristic now matches `<name>.config.<ext>` for JS/TS and data-config extensions (`ts/tsx/js/jsx/mjs/cjs/mts/cts/json/yaml/yml/toml`), so these artifacts are separated from source logic and rescans are less noisy. Matching requires the literal `.config.` segment, so genuine source files such as `config.ts`, `configuration.ts`, and `db-config.ts` are unaffected, and the pattern only fires for the listed extensions, leaving Python/Go/other source untouched.

Vendored deps are excluded via skip-directories (like `node_modules`), but only per-language configs skipped them (Go's `vendor/`, Python's virtualenvs) — the universal skip set held only `.git` and n-dx tooling dirs. A TS-primary repo with a committed `vendor/`, `third_party/`, `bower_components/`, `jspm_packages/`, etc. would therefore walk and classify those files as source, inflating language stats and distorting source-logic analysis. A new universal `VENDOR_SKIP_DIRS` set (`vendor`, `vendored`, `third_party`, `third-party`, `thirdparty`, `bower_components`, `jspm_packages`, `web_modules`, `Godeps`, `.yarn`) is now merged into the skip set for all projects. Directories are matched by exact name at any depth, so a plural `vendors/` directory or a `vendor-utils.ts` source file remains included.

Node can't spawn a `.cmd` directly (post-CVE-2024-27980), and the previous `shell: process.platform === "win32"` workaround triggered the `[DEP0190]` deprecation and broke on paths containing spaces.
  
  - **New `spawnCli` helper** (`@n-dx/llm-client`) routes CLI binaries through `cmd.exe /d /s /c` with `windowsVerbatimArguments` and never uses `shell:true`. Argument quoting follows the Microsoft ArgvQuote / cross-spawn rules (unconditional quoting, backslash-run doubling before quotes, embedded-quote doubling) so paths with spaces and tokens with cmd.exe metacharacters (`& | < > ^ ( )`) are handled. The orchestration tier (`@n-dx/core`) carries an equivalent `win-spawn.js` twin (it cannot import `@n-dx/llm-client`), kept in lockstep by a cross-package parity test.
  - **All CLI-binary spawn sites** are routed through the helper: the claude and codex providers, the hench agent loop and its adapters, the `ndx config` CLI-path validator, `ndx pair-programming`'s reviewer, and sourcevision's `rex` invocations.
  - **Prompts are delivered via stdin** for the codex hench adapter and the pair-programming reviewer (previously passed as an argv token), preventing multi-line prompt truncation and command injection through `cmd.exe`.
  - **`diagnoseCliInvocation`** produces an actionable message when a CLI binary is missing or not invokable — distinguishing a not-found binary, a configured absolute path that doesn't exist, and a binary present on PATH but failing to run — and works from the close/non-zero-exit path on Windows (where a missing `.cmd` never raises `ENOENT`). Detection is anchored to the spawned binary so a legitimate run's own error output isn't misclassified.
  - A **regression guard test** fails CI if any CLI spawn site reintroduces the `shell:true` + args (`DEP0190`) pattern.
  
  No behavior change on macOS or Linux.

Previously, when every enrichment batch failed (e.g. the model timed out), the pass returned only the templated build/asset/docs/config zones and silently dropped the un-enriched code zones — collapsing the analysis to a handful of structural zones with zero cross-zone crossings, despite logging "using algorithmic names". Now a failed pass falls back to the algorithmic Louvain names for the un-enriched code zones (merged with unchanged and templated zones), so a transient LLM outage costs only AI-polished names, not the zone graph or its crossings.

A new `ZONE_ALGORITHM_VERSION` is folded into the fingerprint and bumped, so the next `analyze` recomputes instead of reusing a stale partition — no manual `.sourcevision` deletion or zone pins required.

### Patch Changes

- [#224](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/224) [`aca6ede`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/aca6ede08e1182b5307a27e17ee320a33066b8a8) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - Cut enrichment LLM cost and wall-clock without quality regression.

  **Skip the LLM on structural-only zones.** Zones whose files are entirely
  non-source (build scripts, assets, docs, config — `inventory.role !==
"source"` for every file) get a templated name and description derived
  from their dominant role and top-level directory. On a typical small repo
  this skips ~30–40 % of zones entirely (gotobed: 4 of 9 — Build & CI
  Scripts, App Bundle Resources, Product Website, Project Root). Quality
  loss is negligible because there's nothing for the LLM to analyze in
  these zones beyond "which directory is this in" — the previous LLM
  output was effectively the same templated paraphrase.

  **Use Haiku for pass 1 (naming-dominant), Sonnet for pass 2+.** Pass 1's
  job is mostly zone naming + initial observations; Haiku does that
  accurately in roughly 1/3 the wall-clock of Sonnet and at a fraction of
  the cost. Pass 2+ (cross-zone relationships, anti-patterns, suggestions)
  stays on the standard model so analytical quality doesn't regress.
  Respects `claude.lightModel` / `codex.lightModel` overrides in
  `.n-dx.json` for users who want to pin a specific cheap model.

- [#224](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/224) [`aca6ede`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/aca6ede08e1182b5307a27e17ee320a33066b8a8) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - Phase 0 of the context-graph rework: introduces three foundational primitives
  that downstream finding/zone consumers will gate on.

  - `Zone.evidenceSources?` (imports / proximity / declared / pinned) and
    `Zone.confidence?` so consumers can distinguish import-graph-backed zones
    from proximity-only fallbacks.
  - `Finding.anchors?` (file/line/symbol coordinates) and `Finding.confidence?`
    so unverified hypotheses can be filtered before reaching the user.
  - New `.sourcevision/project-profile.json` (`ProjectProfile` type) capturing
    primary language, detected frameworks (SwiftUI, AppKit, React, …),
    release infrastructure (release-please, changesets, Cargo, pyproject,
    git-tag build scripts), build and CI surfaces, and import-graph quality.

  No behavior changes yet — schema fields are optional and the profile file is
  emitted but not yet consumed by the finding prompt. Subsequent commits gate
  structural findings on `importGraphQuality` and suppress recommendations
  that contradict detected release infrastructure.

- [#224](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/224) [`aca6ede`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/aca6ede08e1182b5307a27e17ee320a33066b8a8) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - Zone clustering now uses an explicit edge-weight model. `ImportEdge` gained an
  optional `weight` field; Louvain prefers it when set (falling back to
  `symbols.length` for any resolver that hasn't opted in). The Swift resolver
  now reports raw reference counts (a file that references `AppEnvironment` 20
  times is structurally more coupled than one that mentions it once), with each
  edge capped at weight 10 so a single hot edge can't dominate zone assignment.
  Net effect on Swift codebases: composition-root files cluster with the layer
  that uses them heavily, not with the layer whose types they happen to
  import.

- [#224](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/224) [`aca6ede`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/aca6ede08e1182b5307a27e17ee320a33066b8a8) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - Make `sv analyze` (and especially `--full`) substantially faster.

  - **Parallel enrichment batches.** Previously batches inside a single
    enrichment pass ran sequentially because each fed an `enrichedNames` hint
    forward to the next. That hint was advisory (collisions are resolved
    post-hoc), so batches now run via `Promise.allSettled`. On a typical
    7-zone repo this roughly halves Phase 4 wall-clock per pass.
  - **Early-exit `--full` on convergence.** The pass loop now fingerprints
    zone identity + finding/insight counts after each pass and stops as soon
    as a pass produces no observable change. Stable codebases routinely run
    4 passes today where 1–2 do all the real work; the rest were dead weight.
  - **`ZONES_PER_BATCH` 5 → 7.** Lets the typical small-to-medium project run
    in a single batch instead of two.
  - **Tightened file-header excerpts.** Per-file cap 800 → 400 chars,
    per-batch budget 6 KB → 2.5 KB. Headers are still useful as ground-truth
    for "is this documented", but the previous budget inflated the full
    prompt enough to consistently miss the 90 s per-call timeout on slower
    networks.
  - **Per-call timeout configurable + default bumped.** `claude` CLI
    invocations now default to 120 s (was 90 s) and respect
    `NDX_CLAUDE_PER_CALL_TIMEOUT_MS=<ms>` for users on slow networks /
    larger prompts. The 90 s cap was killing many legitimate-but-slow
    full-prompt completions before first byte (claude buffers stdout fully,
    so partial progress is invisible).

- [#224](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/224) [`aca6ede`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/aca6ede08e1182b5307a27e17ee320a33066b8a8) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - Stop fabricating findings against documented files. The enrichment prompt now
  includes each batched file's leading doc-comment block as an authoritative
  header excerpt (TS/JS/Swift/Rust/Python/Go/HTML/MD comment conventions are
  recognized). The LLM is explicitly told not to call a documented file
  "undocumented".

  Adds a defensive backstop that drops findings whose text begins with a
  hypothesis ("If X then…", "Should/Might/May/Could/Possibly/Perhaps…",
  "It may/might/could/appears/seems…"). Dropped findings are logged with a
  single-line count so the user knows what was filtered. The prompt guard
  already discouraged these; this filter catches the leaks.

  Also marks `projectDir` as in-memory-only on `ProjectProfile` so the
  on-disk `.sourcevision/project-profile.json` stays portable across machines.

- [#224](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/224) [`aca6ede`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/aca6ede08e1182b5307a27e17ee320a33066b8a8) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - Extend the reference-count edge-weight model to JS/TS imports. The resolver
  now counts how many times each named-import binding actually appears in the
  file body (after the import statement itself) and uses that as the edge
  weight, capped at 10. Same hub-attraction problem the Swift resolver had: a
  file that imports `cheap-helper` and uses it once shouldn't drag toward
  `cheap-helper`'s zone as hard as a file that uses it 30 times. Wildcard and
  default imports keep the baseline weight 1 because there's no parseable
  local alias to count.

- [#224](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/224) [`aca6ede`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/aca6ede08e1182b5307a27e17ee320a33066b8a8) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - Feed the detected project profile into the LLM finding prompt with hard
  constraints that suppress recommendations that don't fit the project's shape:

  - When `importGraphQuality` is `sparse` or `absent` (e.g. a Swift, Rust, or
    Python project with no resolvable JS/TS imports), the LLM is told NOT to
    emit structural findings — those zones come from file-tree proximity and
    can't carry meaningful coupling/cohesion claims.
  - When the repo already has release infrastructure (release-please,
    changesets, package.json, Cargo, pyproject, git-tag build scripts), the LLM
    is told NOT to recommend introducing a VERSION file or competing release
    scheme.
  - When SwiftUI is detected as a framework, the LLM is told not to recommend
    MVVM coordinator/view-model transplants or protocols-for-testability by
    default.
  - When the primary language is anything other than TS/JS, the LLM is told not
    to propose JS/TS-specific patterns (e.g. Combine `.replaceError` on a sink
    whose `Failure` is `Never`).
  - Conditional "If X then Y" findings must be confirmed and rewritten as facts
    or omitted.

- [#224](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/224) [`aca6ede`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/aca6ede08e1182b5307a27e17ee320a33066b8a8) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - Add a Swift import + symbol-reference resolver so sourcevision produces a real
  file→file graph on Swift codebases instead of falling back to proximity-only
  zone detection. Swift's `import X` references modules, not files, so a literal
  import parser would produce zero internal edges — this resolver does two
  passes: (1) external `import X` for framework detection (Foundation, SwiftUI,
  AppKit, etc., classified against an Apple stdlib list), and (2) a project-wide
  declaration index (`class/struct/enum/protocol/actor/extension/typealias`)
  plus a reference scan that emits an internal edge for each project-declared
  symbol used in another file. Comments and string literals are stripped before
  both passes so doc-comment mentions don't produce phantom edges.

  The result is that `importGraphQuality` flips from `"absent"` to `"rich"` on a
  typical SwiftUI app — Louvain produces meaningful zones with real cohesion,
  and the prompt-side gating no longer needs to suppress every structural
  finding on the project.

- [#224](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/224) [`aca6ede`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/aca6ede08e1182b5307a27e17ee320a33066b8a8) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - Register Swift as a first-class language in the language registry so `.swift`
  files are actually discovered and reach the Swift import resolver. Without
  this, `Package.swift` / `.xcodeproj` projects were being treated as TypeScript
  fallback — `.swift` was filtered out of `parseableExtensions` before phase 2
  ran, leaving the import graph empty even though the Swift resolver was wired
  in. Adds the `swiftConfig` (extensions, test/generated patterns, build/skip
  directories, `Package.swift` as module file), wires it through
  `detectLanguage` / `detectLanguages`, and adds Swift to `VALID_LANGUAGE_IDS`.
  Tiebreak preference on tied counts: TypeScript > Swift > Go (preserves the
  legacy "TS wins go.mod+package.json tie" behavior).

- [#224](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/224) [`aca6ede`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/aca6ede08e1182b5307a27e17ee320a33066b8a8) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - Two complementary partitioning fixes that target the "29-file blob with three
  concerns glued together" failure mode on small/medium repos.

  **A. Quarantine out-of-package tests.** When a test file lives in a
  test-only directory (Swift `Tests/<suite>/...`, Vitest/Jest `tests/...`),
  strip it out of Louvain entirely and drop it into its own per-suite
  `tests-<suite>` zone. Tests routinely import production code heavily, which
  previously made Louvain glue the test to whatever it asserted against (a
  classic anti-pattern in the partition).

  Tests COLOCATED with their package (Go's `internal/foo/foo_test.go` next
  to `foo.go`) keep their existing behavior — they stay with the package
  because the directory they live in also contains production code, signaling
  "this test belongs here." Detection: a test directory is "test-only" iff
  no production file shares its directory.

  **B. Project-relative subdivision threshold.** `SUBDIVISION_THRESHOLD` was
  a flat 50 files, meaning a 29-file zone in a 111-file project (26 % of
  the codebase!) never got recursively subdivided. Now `max(12,
floor(totalFiles * 0.15))` — any zone over 15 % of the project triggers
  subdivision regardless of how high its measured cohesion is, because high
  cohesion at large size usually means "many concerns connected by shared
  vocabulary," not "one tight thing."

- [#211](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/211) [`d85139f`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/d85139fab48b4ad66d5b6b1619243b505b96f0fc) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - SourceVision zone-pin determinism, analyze stability, and Map UX.

  **SourceVision** — Stop spurious enrichment-pass resets on a no-op `analyze`
  (partition-independent input fingerprint reused when code/config is unchanged).
  Zone pins whose target zone did not form are no longer silently dropped — a
  grouped warning finding is emitted (issue [#210](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/issues/210), part 1). New
  `sourcevision.zones.anchors` config declares a named zone from a file glob that
  is forced to exist, making single-target pin consolidations deterministic
  across runs (issue [#210](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/issues/210), part 2). `.rex/` and `.hench/` are excluded from the
  file inventory so generated PRD markdown / run logs no longer skew Overview
  language stats.

  **Web** — Codebase/Zone Map overhaul: deterministic grouped grid layout (no
  overlap), flexbox-centered node labels, cursor-anchored bounded zoom/pan
  (wheel + touch pinch), near-fullscreen File Street View modal, Escape as a
  hierarchical back, and a non-hijacking hover hint. Quick Add now resolves the
  rex CLI from the server's own install (fixes `Cannot find module` for non-n-dx
  projects) with a longer smart-add timeout and an actionable no-API-key error.

### Minor Changes

- [#198](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/198) [`4de9d46`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/4de9d46036963129b0e962e1c9aed7e0b9d87262) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Address security findings, fix package publishing regression, and refresh documentation.

  **Security** — clears 27 of 30 Dependabot advisories:

  - `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` ^1.25.3 → ^1.29.0 (rex, sourcevision, web) — fixes cross-client data leak via shared transport reuse (GHSA-345p-7cg4-v4c7) plus transitive `hono`, `@hono/node-server`, `path-to-regexp`, `ajv`, and `qs` advisories.
  - `@anthropic-ai/sdk` ^0.85.0 → ^0.94.0 (hench, llm-client) — fixes insecure default file permissions in the local-filesystem memory tool (GHSA-p7fg-763f-g4gf).
  - `vitest` ^4.0.18 → ^4.1.5 (root) — fixes transitive `vite` and `picomatch` advisories.
  - Adds range-scoped `pnpm.overrides` for `picomatch`, `postcss`, `hono`, `@hono/node-server`, `ajv`, `path-to-regexp`, `qs`, and `vite` to pin patched versions in transitive trees the resolver would otherwise leave on older cached versions.

  Audit drops from 11 high / 21 moderate / 2 low to 1 high / 2 moderate. The remaining advisories (rollup, esbuild, vite reached via `vitepress`) are dev-server-only docs-build vulns deferred to a follow-up.

  **Packaging regression guard** — moves `assistant-assets/` under `packages/core/` so it ships inside the published `@n-dx/core` tarball, and adds two e2e tests to prevent recurrence:

  - `tests/e2e/published-assets-bundled.test.js` — asserts `pnpm pack` includes the assistant-assets payload.
  - `tests/e2e/published-package-loadability.test.js` — installs each packed tarball into a clean fixture and verifies CLIs load.

  **Docs** — README, getting-started, and quickstart updates with screenshots in `documentation/` to walk through `ndx init`, `analyze`, `plan`, `work`, `status`, `start`, `ci`, and `self-heal`.

  - Show prior attempt history in task card (retry count, last status)
  - Classify changes in run summary (code/test/docs/config/metadata-only)

- [#109](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/109) [`9c2963f`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/9c2963fcb95e9e80c4702878c958f486bf5f9fbb) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - ### SourceVision

  - **Zone stability:** Louvain community detection now seeds from previous zone assignments, preserving topology across runs. Files stay in their previous zones unless import structure genuinely shifts.
  - **Zone identity preservation:** Zones with >50% file overlap with a previous zone inherit its ID and name, preventing the LLM from inventing new names each run.
  - **Stability bias:** Synthetic co-zone edges reinforce previous zone membership during Louvain optimization. Configurable weight (default 0.5x median import edge).
  - **Stability reporting:** New `stability` field in zones.json tracks file retention, persisted/new/removed zones, and reassigned files between runs.
  - **Finding category taxonomy:** Findings now carry a `category` field (`structural`, `code`, `documentation`) enabling downstream filtering. LLM prompts request categories; regex heuristic classifies when LLM doesn't provide one.
  - **Finding staleness validation:** Findings referencing deleted/moved files are automatically skipped during `rex recommend`.
  - **Weighted cohesion metrics:** Project-wide averages weighted by zone file count. Zones with <5 files excluded from aggregates (unreliable metrics). Both weighted and unweighted averages reported.
  - **Small-zone merge logging:** Configurable merge threshold with debuggability logging.
  - **Git SHA refresh:** `manifest.gitSha` now updated at analysis start, not just init time.

  ### Rex

  - **Self-heal: exclude structural findings:** `--exclude-structural` flag on `rex recommend` skips zone boundary opinions. Self-heal loop passes it by default.
  - **Self-heal: file-level regression guard:** Progress signals shifted from zone-relative (weighted cohesion) to zone-independent metrics (circular deps, code findings, unused exports).
  - **Zone pin discoverability:** `ndx analyze` suggests zone pins when structural findings detected. `ndx config --help` documents `sourcevision.zones.pins`. `rex recommend` shows pin tip for structural findings.
  - **Workflow split:** Base n-dx workflow in `n-dx_workflow.md` (always updated on init) + user customizations in `workflow.md` (preserved across re-init). Prohibited changes section prevents lint-suppress-only commits.
  - **Stats fix:** Childless features now counted in `get_prd_status` totals.
  - **Config routing:** `sourcevision.*` config keys now route to `.n-dx.json` for zone pin management.

  ### Web Dashboard

  - Zone slideout shows "pinned" badge on files with zone pin overrides.
  - Server augments `/api/sv/zones` response with zone pins from `.n-dx.json`.

  ### CLI

  - Fix release workflow: use bash wrapper script for changeset version command (changesets/action splits on whitespace without a shell).

- [#99](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/99) [`17e486a`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/17e486a391d85a65e62d231539bff0a2ee212dc8) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - ### Rex

  - Proactive PRD structure health checks with configurable thresholds
  - Post-write health warnings on `rex add` and `rex analyze`
  - Structure health gate in `ndx ci` (fails below score 50)

  ### Web Dashboard

  - Checkbox multi-select: hover reveals checkbox, click row opens detail panel
  - Remove Edit icon from tree rows (detail panel handles editing)
  - Completion timeline view with date range filters (today/week/month/all)

  ### CLI

  - Fix release workflow: use `npx` for changeset commands (pnpm script resolution bug)
