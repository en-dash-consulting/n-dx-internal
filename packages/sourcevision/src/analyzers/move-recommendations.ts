/**
 * File-move recommendation engine.
 *
 * Detects files whose physical location diverges from their architectural zone
 * membership and emits concrete move-file findings with predicted metric impact.
 *
 * Two detection strategies:
 *
 * 1. **Pin divergence** — A zone pin overrides Louvain placement, meaning the
 *    file's import structure says "zone A" but a human pinned it to "zone B".
 *    If zone B has a clear directory majority, suggest moving the file there.
 *
 * 2. **Import neighbor majority** — A file's import neighbors (both importers
 *    and importees) are predominantly in a different directory. This suggests
 *    the file has drifted from its logical home.
