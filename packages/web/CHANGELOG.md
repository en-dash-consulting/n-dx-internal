### Patch Changes

- [#216](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/216) [`29bd146`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/29bd14608135ee9b0ae1168f77226113436da67a) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - Fix dashboard proposal acceptance silently dropping items. The
  `/api/rex/proposals/accept` and `/api/rex/proposals/accept-edited`
  handlers wrote new items via `savePRD` — which targets the legacy
  `prd.md` + ephemeral cache — instead of the folder tree
  (`.rex/prd_tree/`), the authoritative PRD surface per CLAUDE.md. The
  folder-tree watcher then rebuilt the cache from the unchanged tree, so
  accepted epics/features/tasks vanished with no error. Both handlers
  now write through `resolveStore().addItem()` and refresh the cache
  from the store so the dashboard sees the new items immediately.

- [#218](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/218) [`f966861`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/f9668613ebf031ebb1417903157ab5dc277b16a0) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - Redesign the Hench Runs view so the run history is the focus. The four
  operational diagnostic panels (concurrency, memory, WebSocket health, throttle)
  that previously stacked above the run list now live in a collapsed "System
  status" drawer at the bottom, and the WebSocket health panel — previously
  rendered with no CSS — is now styled to match the other panels.

- [#206](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/206) [`d278f05`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/d278f0506c94ae8bce068f770caa450e07a3330e) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Rework the PRD context graph, harden the hench run loop, and add LLM auto-failover.

  **PRD context graph (web)** — Top-down progressive-disclosure layout with folder-tree
  visual style; shape-based nodes for epic/feature/task/subtask; click-through opens the
  Rex task detail panel with subtree highlighting. Hierarchy is now driven from
  `.rex/prd_tree/` paths.

  **Hench run loop** — Per-task attempt tracking, completed tasks excluded from
  selection, and the loop advances immediately on success. The `no-plan-mode` rule is
  embedded in the agent system prompt; autonomous runs (`--auto` / `--loop` /
  `--epic-by-epic`) default to `acceptEdits`. New
  `docs/contributing/run-loop-invariants.md`.

  **LLM auto-failover** — New `llm.autoFailover` flag with vendor-specific failover
  chains; `hench run` restores the original config after a failover attempt. Model
  resolution honours top-level `llm.model` → `llm.{vendor}.model` → tier default.

  **Rex storage** — PRD tree rewritten to canonical `index.md`-per-folder layout with
  single-child compaction and atomic leaf-to-folder promotion for subtasks. Timestamped
  snapshots before structural migrations; cross-PRD duplicate detection in `reshape`.

  **CLI / DX** — New `ndx tree` command and tree-formatted `rex status`; `ndx self-heal`
  gains a pre-execution approval gate with `selfHeal.autoConfirm`. Obfuscated-code commit
  blocker added.

- [#216](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/216) [`29bd146`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/29bd14608135ee9b0ae1168f77226113436da67a) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - PRD tree row decluttered. The Token Usage cell is now gated on the
  `showTokenBudget` feature flag (no more noisy column on every row when
  budgets aren't active). Duration and timestamp are removed from the
  row — both still live in the task detail flyout. The level badge
  (`EPIC` / `FEATURE` / `TASK` / `SUBTASK`) now renders only on the
  first item of each contiguous same-level group, so it reads as a
  section header for that indentation instead of repeating on every
  row. Status remains an icon-only indicator with the full label on
  hover.

- [#218](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/218) [`f966861`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/f9668613ebf031ebb1417903157ab5dc277b16a0) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - Fix two Tasks-view bugs: Quick Add now persists `acceptanceCriteria` on
  accepted task proposals (it was dropped client-side in both the direct-accept
  and proposal-editor paths), and the dashboard "Start Task" button now launches
  an autonomous hench run for the task via `/api/hench/execute` instead of merely
  flipping its status to in_progress.

- [#216](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/216) [`29bd146`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/29bd14608135ee9b0ae1168f77226113436da67a) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - Smart-add fixes — nesting, dashboard Quick Add, and clearer errors.

  **Nesting (rex):** `n-dx add` no longer creates a duplicate epic when the work
  belongs under an existing one. The LLM was supposed to set `existingId` for
  placement under an existing epic/feature but often omitted it. Added a
  deterministic post-generation pass that matches proposed epics/features
  against existing PRD containers (high-confidence, title-based) and fills
  `existingId` so the new task nests instead of duplicating. Respects an
  `existingId` the LLM already set; skipped when an explicit `--parent` is
  given.

  **Dashboard Quick Add latency (rex + web):** new `--fast` flag for `rex add`
  forces the vendor's light tier (haiku for Claude, gpt-5.4-mini for Codex) so
  the CLI provider completes well within the timeout from a daemonized server.
  The web Quick Add preview now passes `--fast`; the user-driven CLI
  `n-dx add` is unchanged.

  **Timeout error message (web):** the smart-add timeout no longer wrongly
  implies "set an API key" is the fix — the Claude CLI provider is a valid
  first-class path. The message now points at the right diagnostic
  (`time claude -p`), notes an API key is only an optional speed-up, and
  appends captured stderr when present.

- [#211](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/211) [`d85139f`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/d85139fab48b4ad66d5b6b1619243b505b96f0fc) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - SourceVision zone-pin determinism, analyze stability, and Map UX.

  **SourceVision** — Stop spurious enrichment-pass resets on a no-op `analyze`
  (partition-independent input fingerprint reused when code/config is unchanged).
  Zone pins whose target zone did not form are no longer silently dropped — a
  grouped warning finding is emitted (issue [#210](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/issues/210), part 1). New
  `sourcevision.zones.anchors` config declares a named zone from a file glob that
  is forced to exist, making single-target pin consolidations deterministic
  across runs (issue [#210](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/issues/210), part 2). `.rex/` and `.hench/` are excluded from the
  file inventory so generated PRD markdown / run logs no longer skew Overview
  language stats.

  **Web** — Codebase/Zone Map overhaul: deterministic grouped grid layout (no
  overlap), flexbox-centered node labels, cursor-anchored bounded zoom/pan
  (wheel + touch pinch), near-fullscreen File Street View modal, Escape as a
  hierarchical back, and a non-hijacking hover hint. Quick Add now resolves the
  rex CLI from the server's own install (fixes `Cannot find module` for non-n-dx
  projects) with a longer smart-add timeout and an actionable no-API-key error.

- [#218](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/218) [`f966861`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/f9668613ebf031ebb1417903157ab5dc277b16a0) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - Rework the Rex Tasks view status filter and initial state. The status filter is
  now a multi-select dropdown showing per-status counts with "View all" and
  "Pending only" quick actions. On a fresh load the tree defaults to showing only
  pending items when any exist (otherwise all statuses), and the tree now starts
  fully collapsed.

- [#218](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/218) [`f966861`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/f9668613ebf031ebb1417903157ab5dc277b16a0) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - Redesign the Rex Tasks view controls and fix scrolling. Replaces the stacked
  filter UI with a two-row control bar (search + match count + inline actions on
  top, icon-only status pills + tag typeahead below) and collapses the nested
  scroll regions into a single bounded scroller so the task list is the only thing
  that scrolls.

### Minor Changes

- [#198](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/198) [`4de9d46`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/4de9d46036963129b0e962e1c9aed7e0b9d87262) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Address security findings, fix package publishing regression, and refresh documentation.

  **Security** — clears 27 of 30 Dependabot advisories:

  - `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` ^1.25.3 → ^1.29.0 (rex, sourcevision, web) — fixes cross-client data leak via shared transport reuse (GHSA-345p-7cg4-v4c7) plus transitive `hono`, `@hono/node-server`, `path-to-regexp`, `ajv`, and `qs` advisories.
  - `@anthropic-ai/sdk` ^0.85.0 → ^0.94.0 (hench, llm-client) — fixes insecure default file permissions in the local-filesystem memory tool (GHSA-p7fg-763f-g4gf).
  - `vitest` ^4.0.18 → ^4.1.5 (root) — fixes transitive `vite` and `picomatch` advisories.
  - Adds range-scoped `pnpm.overrides` for `picomatch`, `postcss`, `hono`, `@hono/node-server`, `ajv`, `path-to-regexp`, `qs`, and `vite` to pin patched versions in transitive trees the resolver would otherwise leave on older cached versions.

  Audit drops from 11 high / 21 moderate / 2 low to 1 high / 2 moderate. The remaining advisories (rollup, esbuild, vite reached via `vitepress`) are dev-server-only docs-build vulns deferred to a follow-up.

  **Packaging regression guard** — moves `assistant-assets/` under `packages/core/` so it ships inside the published `@n-dx/core` tarball, and adds two e2e tests to prevent recurrence:

  - `tests/e2e/published-assets-bundled.test.js` — asserts `pnpm pack` includes the assistant-assets payload.
  - `tests/e2e/published-package-loadability.test.js` — installs each packed tarball into a clean fixture and verifies CLIs load.

  **Docs** — README, getting-started, and quickstart updates with screenshots in `documentation/` to walk through `ndx init`, `analyze`, `plan`, `work`, `status`, `start`, `ci`, and `self-heal`.

  - `/ndx-capture` skill updated with automatic parent placement and dependency wiring

- [#109](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/109) [`9c2963f`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/9c2963fcb95e9e80c4702878c958f486bf5f9fbb) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - ### SourceVision

  - **Zone stability:** Louvain community detection now seeds from previous zone assignments, preserving topology across runs. Files stay in their previous zones unless import structure genuinely shifts.
  - **Zone identity preservation:** Zones with >50% file overlap with a previous zone inherit its ID and name, preventing the LLM from inventing new names each run.
  - **Stability bias:** Synthetic co-zone edges reinforce previous zone membership during Louvain optimization. Configurable weight (default 0.5x median import edge).
  - **Stability reporting:** New `stability` field in zones.json tracks file retention, persisted/new/removed zones, and reassigned files between runs.
  - **Finding category taxonomy:** Findings now carry a `category` field (`structural`, `code`, `documentation`) enabling downstream filtering. LLM prompts request categories; regex heuristic classifies when LLM doesn't provide one.
  - **Finding staleness validation:** Findings referencing deleted/moved files are automatically skipped during `rex recommend`.
  - **Weighted cohesion metrics:** Project-wide averages weighted by zone file count. Zones with <5 files excluded from aggregates (unreliable metrics). Both weighted and unweighted averages reported.
  - **Small-zone merge logging:** Configurable merge threshold with debuggability logging.
  - **Git SHA refresh:** `manifest.gitSha` now updated at analysis start, not just init time.

  ### Rex

  - **Self-heal: exclude structural findings:** `--exclude-structural` flag on `rex recommend` skips zone boundary opinions. Self-heal loop passes it by default.
  - **Self-heal: file-level regression guard:** Progress signals shifted from zone-relative (weighted cohesion) to zone-independent metrics (circular deps, code findings, unused exports).
  - **Zone pin discoverability:** `ndx analyze` suggests zone pins when structural findings detected. `ndx config --help` documents `sourcevision.zones.pins`. `rex recommend` shows pin tip for structural findings.
  - **Workflow split:** Base n-dx workflow in `n-dx_workflow.md` (always updated on init) + user customizations in `workflow.md` (preserved across re-init). Prohibited changes section prevents lint-suppress-only commits.
  - **Stats fix:** Childless features now counted in `get_prd_status` totals.
  - **Config routing:** `sourcevision.*` config keys now route to `.n-dx.json` for zone pin management.

  ### Web Dashboard

  - Zone slideout shows "pinned" badge on files with zone pin overrides.
  - Server augments `/api/sv/zones` response with zone pins from `.n-dx.json`.

  ### CLI

  - Fix release workflow: use bash wrapper script for changeset version command (changesets/action splits on whitespace without a shell).

- [#99](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/99) [`17e486a`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/17e486a391d85a65e62d231539bff0a2ee212dc8) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - ### Rex

  - Proactive PRD structure health checks with configurable thresholds
  - Post-write health warnings on `rex add` and `rex analyze`
  - Structure health gate in `ndx ci` (fails below score 50)

  ### Web Dashboard

  - Checkbox multi-select: hover reveals checkbox, click row opens detail panel
  - Remove Edit icon from tree rows (detail panel handles editing)
  - Completion timeline view with date range filters (today/week/month/all)

  ### CLI

  - Fix release workflow: use `npx` for changeset commands (pnpm script resolution bug)
