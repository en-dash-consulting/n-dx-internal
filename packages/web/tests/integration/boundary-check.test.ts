/**
 * Server/client boundary enforcement test.
 *
 * Ensures no import crosses the boundary between src/server/ and src/viewer/.
 * This catches accidental coupling that would not be flagged by the build
 * since both sides compile under the same tsconfig.
 *
 * @see tests/e2e/domain-isolation.test.js — cross-package gateway enforcement
 * @see tests/e2e/architecture-policy.test.js — orchestration spawn-only + zone cycle detection
 *
 * These three test files together enforce the full architectural guardrail suite.
 * Changes to one should be reviewed against the others for consistency.
