/**
 * Server/client boundary enforcement test.
 *
 * Ensures no import crosses the boundary between src/server/ and src/viewer/.
 * This catches accidental coupling that would not be flagged by the build
 * since both sides compile under the same tsconfig.
 *
 * @see tests/e2e/domain-isolation.test.js — cross-package gateway enforcement
 * @see tests/e2e/architecture-policy.test.js — orchestration spawn-only + zone cycle detection
 *
 * These three test files together enforce the full architectural guardrail suite.
 * Changes to one should be reviewed against the others for consistency.
 *
 * ## Known limitations of regex-based import extraction
 *
 * The `extractImportPaths()` function uses a regex to match static import/export
 * statements. This approach is intentionally lightweight (no AST parse) but has
 * blind spots:
 *
 *   1. **Dynamic imports** — `await import("./path")` and `import("./path")` are
 *      not detected. Two critical dynamic import paths exist in the monorepo:
 *      `rex/src/cli/commands/analyze.ts` and `rex/src/cli/index.ts`. A separate
 *      dynamic-import-audit test in architecture-policy.test.js covers these.
 *   2. **Template-literal paths** — ``import(`./locales/${lang}`)`` is invisible.
 *   3. **Multiline import statements** — Imports split across lines may be missed
 *      if the `from "..."` portion is on a different line than the `import` keyword.
 *
 * Any new enforcement assertion added to this file inherits these blind spots.
 * For boundary-critical dynamic imports, consider a separate grep-based check.
