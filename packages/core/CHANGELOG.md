### Patch Changes

- [#317](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/317) [`68616e5`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/68616e550d0b062cee6add7e18df69a65164dd92) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Surface concise re-authentication guidance when a provider rejects credentials, and stop dumping raw JSON error payloads.

  A new canonical helper in `@n-dx/llm-client` (`authFailureGuidance` / `authFailureMessage`) is the single source of truth for auth-failure wording: it names the provider, states the cause (`Invalid or expired credentials`), and gives the exact fix — `claude logout && claude login`, `codex logout && codex login`, or `ndx config llm.google.api_key <KEY>`. Every entry point now reads identically:

  - **`ndx init` / `ndx config llm.vendor`** — the core preflight (`packages/core/config.js`) replaces the verbose `Details: <raw JSON>` dump with the concise, ANSI-colored guidance (red headline, yellow remediation). The NDX error code (e.g. `NDX_CLAUDE_PREFLIGHT_AUTH_REQUIRED`) is demoted to a dim secondary line instead of the headline, and JSON payloads are never printed. A missing Google key gets a distinct "No API key configured" message.
  - **`ndx work`** — the runtime LLM providers already throw `AuthFailureError`; its message is now the canonical, JSON-free line.
  - **`ndx plan` / `ndx analyze`** — rex/sourcevision route auth errors through the shared classifier and (for rex) render `AuthFailureError` with the shared remediation.

- [#309](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/309) [`56a63ea`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/56a63ea6ef7911166578df2d5bab88e5d6c89d04) Thanks [@stevemikedan](https://github.com/stevemikedan)! - Close out Codex workflow parity ([#122](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/issues/122)) and fix the skill-tracking asymmetry ([#284](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/issues/284)).

  - **Body-drift regression test** — a new e2e test regenerates the assistant artifacts from the canonical source (`assistant-assets/`) and asserts the committed `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and every vendor `SKILL.md` match the generator. This closes the last acceptance gap of [#122](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/issues/122) (tests now fail on body drift, not just inventory drift). It immediately caught a real drift: the committed `CLAUDE.md` carried a `## Changeset Versioning` section that was never in the canonical `project-guidance.md`, so `AGENTS.md` silently lacked it — that section is now in the shared source and both instruction files carry it.
  - **[#284](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/issues/284) — commit both:** the generated Claude `ndx-*` skills were gitignored while the Codex skills were committed, so cloned checkouts lacked the `/ndx-*` skills for Claude until re-init. `.claude/skills/` is removed from `.gitignore`, the generated skills are committed (and LF-pinned in `.gitattributes`, matching `.agents/skills/`), and `ndx init` now warns via `checkSkillTracking()` when an enabled assistant's skill directory is gitignored.
  - **Docs sweep:** the web package README and the troubleshooting guide no longer describe MCP setup as Claude-only.

- [#298](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/298) [`1031719`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/1031719e295722833e2982c720e93ff56a929fad) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Register MCP servers using the discovered claude CLI path instead of a bare `claude` literal. `registerMcpServers` computed `claudeCmd = discovery.path` but the `claude mcp remove` / `claude mcp add` commands still shelled out to the literal string `claude`, requiring it on `PATH`. When `discoverClaudeCli` resolved claude at a well-known location that is not on `PATH` — notably Windows `%APPDATA%\npm\claude.cmd` / `claude.exe`, but also nvm and Homebrew installs — `ndx init` silently failed to register the rex and sourcevision MCP servers even though discovery had succeeded. Both commands now invoke the quoted discovered path, so MCP registration works on installs where claude is not on `PATH`.

- [#309](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/309) [`56a63ea`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/56a63ea6ef7911166578df2d5bab88e5d6c89d04) Thanks [@stevemikedan](https://github.com/stevemikedan)! - Complete the `.gitattributes` LF-pin coverage (follow-up to [#283](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/issues/283)/[#285](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/issues/285)). Three n-dx-written surfaces were writing LF but had no eol pin, so Windows checkouts (`core.autocrlf=true`) showed line-ending-only churn on every tool write:

  - `.claude/skills/**/*.md` — generated Claude skills (now committed per [#284](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/issues/284))
  - `.codex/config.toml` — generated Codex MCP config
  - `.sourcevision/**/*.txt` — sourcevision text output (e.g. `llms.txt`)

  All three are added to both `GITATTRIBUTES_EOL_RULES` (the list `ndx init` injects into a project's `.gitattributes`) and n-dx's own `.gitattributes`, keeping the two in sync per the stated invariant.

  The root cause of the pins shipping incomplete was that these two sources drifted apart — one updated, the other not — and no test caught it. To close that class of bug for good:

  - The rules are extracted into a single importable source of truth (`packages/core/gitattributes-pins.js`), imported by `cli.js`.
  - A **sync-guard test** (`prd-line-endings.test.js`) asserts the injector's pattern set equals n-dx's own `.gitattributes` `eol=lf` pattern set — any future divergence fails CI, not just the three patterns fixed today. `cli-init.test.js` also asserts the new patterns are injected.

- [#285](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/285) [`437c27a`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/437c27a7645e2db0ab6b666384e1f210cc4ff21f) Thanks [@stevemikedan](https://github.com/stevemikedan)! - `ndx init` now writes (or merges into) the target project's `.gitattributes`, pinning every n-dx-written tracked file (`.rex/`, `.hench/`, `.sourcevision/`, `.n-dx.json`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.agents/`) to `text eol=lf`. This stops Windows checkouts (`core.autocrlf=true`) from showing spurious line-ending-only modifications after every tool write. Existing `.gitattributes` content is preserved and user rules for overlapping patterns win; re-running `ndx init` is idempotent.

- [#317](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/317) [`68616e5`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/68616e550d0b062cee6add7e18df69a65164dd92) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Make the hench pre-run commit gate size-aware with configurable thresholds.

  The gate now measures change magnitude (dirty file count plus lines changed vs HEAD via `git diff --numstat`, shared helper `measureChangeMagnitude`) instead of reacting only to a non-empty dirty list. Two new persisted settings under `hench.git.*` (`.hench/config.json`, editable via `ndx config`):

  - **`hench.git.checkpointThreshold`** (default: 200, 0 disables) — at/above this many changed lines, the interactive prompt warns about the change size and defaults to committing a checkpoint instead of proceeding. Below the threshold, behavior is unchanged.
  - **`hench.git.requireCleanTree`** (default: false) — refuse to start against a dirty tree: the interactive prompt drops the "proceed" option and non-interactive runs (`--yes`, piped) abort.

  Autonomous runs (`--auto`/`--loop`/`--epic-by-epic`) keep today's behavior — abort on any dirty tree unless `--allow-dirty` — but the refusal now reports the measured magnitude. `--allow-dirty` takes precedence over both config settings for a single run (flag > config > defaults). Documented in `hench run --help` and `ndx config --help`.

- [#317](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/317) [`68616e5`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/68616e550d0b062cee6add7e18df69a65164dd92) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Add `ndx auth` — on-demand credential verification for the active LLM vendor.

  The command re-runs the same provider auth preflight used by `ndx init` / `ndx config llm.vendor` and exits 0 when credentials are valid (printing the active vendor, resolved model, and "credentials valid") or 1 on failure (printing the canonical, JSON-free auth-failure guidance). It works without an initialized project — the default vendor (claude) is checked when no config exists.

  Every vendor's auth-failure remediation (and the flattened `authFailureMessage` used by runtime errors) now ends with the canonical verification step `Verify credentials: ndx auth`, exported from `@n-dx/llm-client` as `VERIFY_CREDENTIALS_STEP`, so users always know how to confirm a fix.

- [#298](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/298) [`1031719`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/1031719e295722833e2982c720e93ff56a929fad) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Reconcile Codex model identifiers across the config surface. Removed the dead `gpt-5.4mini` legacy alias from `LEGACY_CODEX_MODEL_ALIASES` (its target `gpt-5.4-mini` is already a direct catalog model and the non-hyphen key was never a shipped ID). The remaining legacy brand IDs (`gpt-5-codex`, `gpt-5.1-codex-max`, `gpt-5.1-codex-mini`) now match the orchestration-tier list in `init-llm.js`, with cross-reference comments pinning the two tiers together. Updated the hench vendor-compatibility error hint from the outdated `gpt-4o, o1` to current Codex models (`gpt-5.5, gpt-5.4-mini`).

- [#279](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/279) [`18b36f7`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/18b36f73c0b18bdf508b956e3fb42e5bbf5aeabd) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Refresh the Claude model catalog shown in `ndx init` and align the runtime default. Adds **Claude Fable 5** (`claude-fable-5`) and **Claude Sonnet 5** (`claude-sonnet-5`) to the selector, and promotes Sonnet 5 to the recommended default (replacing the previous-generation Sonnet 4.6 as the pre-selected model and as `DEFAULT_CLAUDE_MODEL` / `NEWEST_MODELS.claude`). Sonnet 5's 1M context window and pricing are registered for budget preflight. `claude-sonnet-4-6` remains a valid, accepted model id (kept in the context/cost maps and added to the init legacy-alias list) so existing configs and `--claude-model=claude-sonnet-4-6` keep working without warnings. Codex and Gemini catalogs are unchanged.

- [#323](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/323) [`261c839`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/261c839396af3063f1d0f9a50657e86dd275a22d) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - The "Update available" notice now suggests an upgrade command that actually works.

  Previously it always printed `npm i -g @n-dx/core`, regardless of how the copy was installed, which failed two ways:

  - **Wrong package manager.** A pnpm-global user following `npm i -g` ends up with a second global install under the npm prefix. Both ship an `ndx` shim, and whichever resolves first on `PATH` wins — so `ndx --version` can keep reporting the old version even though the upgrade "succeeded". `update-check.js` now infers the installing manager from its own path on disk (pnpm's `.pnpm` virtual store, yarn's data directory, else npm) and prints the matching `pnpm add -g` / `yarn global add` / `npm i -g` form.
  - **Missing `@latest`.** pnpm records a caret range in its global manifest, and for 0.x versions `^0.3.1` means `>=0.3.1 <0.4.0`. A bare `pnpm add -g @n-dx/core` or `pnpm update -g` re-resolves inside that range and can never cross a minor boundary, leaving users stranded on an old line indefinitely. The suggested command now always pins `@n-dx/core@latest`.

  Adds a `docs/guide/troubleshooting.md` entry for the `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND … assistant-assets/index.js` crash that 0.3.x installs hit, since that failure occurs while Node links the module graph — before any `ndx` code can run and surface an update notice. Documents the upgrade-pinning rule in the README install section.

- [#323](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/323) [`261c839`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/261c839396af3063f1d0f9a50657e86dd275a22d) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Stop quoting bare command names in the Windows cmd.exe verbatim command line so PATHEXT resolution still applies. `buildWindowsCliCommandLine` quoted every token including the binary, and a quoted command name makes cmd.exe look for an exact filename match on PATH instead of trying `.CMD`/`.EXE`/… in turn. When a PATH directory holds an extensionless file beside its shim — exactly what pnpm/npm global installs produce (`pnpm` + `pnpm.CMD`, `claude` + `claude.CMD`) — cmd found the extensionless POSIX script, failed `CreateProcess`, and exited 1 with `The system cannot find the path specified.`, making the CLI look absent on Windows. Arguments are still quoted unconditionally and binary paths containing spaces or metacharacters keep their quotes, so the GH [#68](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/issues/68) spaced-path handling is unchanged. Non-Windows platforms are unaffected — they use a plain `spawn` and never build a cmd.exe command line.

- [#299](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/299) [`ab24172`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/ab241723f3822cca76e801d4628289b3c45b0b84) Thanks [@stevemikedan](https://github.com/stevemikedan)! - Harden CLI spawning on Windows so launching `.cmd` shims (claude, codex, rex) no longer fails. Node can't spawn a `.cmd` directly (post-CVE-2024-27980), and the previous `shell: process.platform === "win32"` workaround triggered the `[DEP0190]` deprecation and broke on paths containing spaces.

  - **New `spawnCli` helper** (`@n-dx/llm-client`) routes CLI binaries through `cmd.exe /d /s /c` with `windowsVerbatimArguments` and never uses `shell:true`. Argument quoting follows the Microsoft ArgvQuote / cross-spawn rules (unconditional quoting, backslash-run doubling before quotes, embedded-quote doubling) so paths with spaces and tokens with cmd.exe metacharacters (`& | < > ^ ( )`) are handled. The orchestration tier (`@n-dx/core`) carries an equivalent `win-spawn.js` twin (it cannot import `@n-dx/llm-client`), kept in lockstep by a cross-package parity test.
  - **All CLI-binary spawn sites** are routed through the helper: the claude and codex providers, the hench agent loop and its adapters, the `ndx config` CLI-path validator, `ndx pair-programming`'s reviewer, and sourcevision's `rex` invocations.
  - **Prompts are delivered via stdin** for the codex hench adapter and the pair-programming reviewer (previously passed as an argv token), preventing multi-line prompt truncation and command injection through `cmd.exe`.
  - **`diagnoseCliInvocation`** produces an actionable message when a CLI binary is missing or not invokable — distinguishing a not-found binary, a configured absolute path that doesn't exist, and a binary present on PATH but failing to run — and works from the close/non-zero-exit path on Windows (where a missing `.cmd` never raises `ENOENT`). Detection is anchored to the spawned binary so a legitimate run's own error output isn't misclassified.
  - A **regression guard test** fails CI if any CLI spawn site reintroduces the `shell:true` + args (`DEP0190`) pattern.

  No behavior change on macOS or Linux.

### Patch Changes

- [#268](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/268) [`be3b1d9`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/be3b1d98f70e6df6b031ed023fb7f8f5a96dba6a) Thanks [@stevemikedan](https://github.com/stevemikedan)! - Fix `ndx plan --no-llm` not suppressing LLM calls in sourcevision zone enrichment. The flag was filtered out before being passed to `sourcevision analyze`; now maps to `--fast` (skip AI enrichment) so the full pipeline respects the flag.

- [#267](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/267) [`579d831`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/579d831018b949938f6ad18a0a637315a2b9b352) Thanks [@stevemikedan](https://github.com/stevemikedan)! - Fix `ndx ci` on Windows: pnpm is a `.cmd` shim and requires `shell: true` to resolve without ENOENT. Add `shell: process.platform === "win32"` to the docs-build spawn in `ci.js`.

- [#243](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/243) [`925d9a8`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/925d9a846e35ca8cbd98084ff5aa0152bc486f99) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - Record `/ndx-work` task execution in hench run history ([#271](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/issues/271)). The `/ndx-work` skill drove tasks through Claude Code without spawning hench, so the work left no `.hench/runs/` entry and was invisible to run history and `ndx usage`. A new `hench record` command writes a lightweight run record (task id, title, status, summary, timestamps, model) marked `assisted`, and the skill now calls it as a final step. Because Claude Code does not expose its own token consumption to a running skill, assisted records carry empty token usage and an `assisted` flag so analytics can distinguish them from genuine hench runs rather than reading them as anomalies; the skill also surfaces this caveat to the user.

### Patch Changes

- [#233](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/233) [`a31403d`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/a31403d8438cfea90f87abff1caf70f92d07e64c) Thanks [@dnaniel](https://github.com/dnaniel)! - Fix: include `self-heal-confirm.js` in the published `@n-dx/core` tarball.
  The file exists in source and is imported by `cli.js` (line 50), but was
  missing from `package.json`'s `files` array, so 0.4.3 published without
  it and `ndx` crashed at startup with
  `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find module … self-heal-confirm.js`.

  Because the changeset config groups all six `@n-dx/*` packages as
  `fixed`, this patch bumps the whole set to 0.4.4 — the other five
  packages republish unchanged but at the new version.

  made it to the registry because the original NPM_TOKEN-based publish in
  the Release run for [#227](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/issues/227) returned E404. Workflow now uses OIDC; this
  changeset moves all six packages to 0.4.3 so they get published with

### Patch Changes

- [#206](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/206) [`d278f05`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/d278f0506c94ae8bce068f770caa450e07a3330e) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Rework the PRD context graph, harden the hench run loop, and add LLM auto-failover.

  **PRD context graph (web)** — Top-down progressive-disclosure layout with folder-tree
  visual style; shape-based nodes for epic/feature/task/subtask; click-through opens the
  Rex task detail panel with subtree highlighting. Hierarchy is now driven from
  `.rex/prd_tree/` paths.

  **Hench run loop** — Per-task attempt tracking, completed tasks excluded from
  selection, and the loop advances immediately on success. The `no-plan-mode` rule is
  embedded in the agent system prompt; autonomous runs (`--auto` / `--loop` /
  `--epic-by-epic`) default to `acceptEdits`. New
  `docs/contributing/run-loop-invariants.md`.

  **LLM auto-failover** — New `llm.autoFailover` flag with vendor-specific failover
  chains; `hench run` restores the original config after a failover attempt. Model
  resolution honours top-level `llm.model` → `llm.{vendor}.model` → tier default.

  **Rex storage** — PRD tree rewritten to canonical `index.md`-per-folder layout with
  single-child compaction and atomic leaf-to-folder promotion for subtasks. Timestamped
  snapshots before structural migrations; cross-PRD duplicate detection in `reshape`.

  **CLI / DX** — New `ndx tree` command and tree-formatted `rex status`; `ndx self-heal`
  gains a pre-execution approval gate with `selfHeal.autoConfirm`. Obfuscated-code commit
  blocker added.

### Minor Changes

- [#198](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/pull/198) [`4de9d46`](https://github.com/en-dash-consulting/n-dx/commit/4de9d46036963129b0e962e1c9aed7e0b9d87262) Thanks [@endash-shal](https://github.com/endash-shal)! - Address security findings, fix package publishing regression, and refresh documentation.

  **Security** — clears 27 of 30 Dependabot advisories:

  - `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` ^1.25.3 → ^1.29.0 (rex, sourcevision, web) — fixes cross-client data leak via shared transport reuse (GHSA-345p-7cg4-v4c7) plus transitive `hono`, `@hono/node-server`, `path-to-regexp`, `ajv`, and `qs` advisories.
  - `@anthropic-ai/sdk` ^0.85.0 → ^0.94.0 (hench, llm-client) — fixes insecure default file permissions in the local-filesystem memory tool (GHSA-p7fg-763f-g4gf).
  - `vitest` ^4.0.18 → ^4.1.5 (root) — fixes transitive `vite` and `picomatch` advisories.
  - Adds range-scoped `pnpm.overrides` for `picomatch`, `postcss`, `hono`, `@hono/node-server`, `ajv`, `path-to-regexp`, `qs`, and `vite` to pin patched versions in transitive trees the resolver would otherwise leave on older cached versions.

  Audit drops from 11 high / 21 moderate / 2 low to 1 high / 2 moderate. The remaining advisories (rollup, esbuild, vite reached via `vitepress`) are dev-server-only docs-build vulns deferred to a follow-up.

  **Packaging regression guard** — moves `assistant-assets/` under `packages/core/` so it ships inside the published `@n-dx/core` tarball, and adds two e2e tests to prevent recurrence:

  - `tests/e2e/published-assets-bundled.test.js` — asserts `pnpm pack` includes the assistant-assets payload.
  - `tests/e2e/published-package-loadability.test.js` — installs each packed tarball into a clean fixture and verifies CLIs load.

  **Docs** — README, getting-started, and quickstart updates with screenshots in `documentation/` to walk through `ndx init`, `analyze`, `plan`, `work`, `status`, `start`, `ci`, and `self-heal`.

  - `packages/core/package.json` `files` array was missing `assistant-integration.js` and `codex-integration.js`
  - `cli.js` statically imports `assistant-integration.js`, which in turn statically imports `codex-integration.js`, so the resolution failure happened at module load before any error handling could run
