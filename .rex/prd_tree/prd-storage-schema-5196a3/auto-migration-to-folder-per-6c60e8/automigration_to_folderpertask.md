description: "Make ndx reshape and ndx add idempotently bring any pre-existing PRD tree into compliance with the folder-per-task rule, converting bare task .md files into folder/index.md form and promoting subtask .md files that have orphaned child siblings. Always snapshot .rex/prd_tree to a timestamped backup before mutating, so a failed migration can be rolled back without data loss."
