# Enforce folder-with-index.md storage for tasks and dual-mode subtask serialization

🟠 [pending]

## Summary

Update the PRD folder-tree serializer and parser so every task-level item is always written as a directory named by its title slug containing an index.md file, while subtasks may be either a leaf .md file (no children) or a recursive folder (with children) following the same rule. Includes round-trip parser/serializer fidelity, uniqueness checks reusing the existing title-uniqueness validation, and updates to all PRD write paths (rex CLI add/edit, MCP add_item/edit_item, ndx plan acceptance, hench commit-time updates).
