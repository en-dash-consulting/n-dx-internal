acceptanceCriteria:
  - "A single shared predicate filters completed tasks out of all hench selection paths"
  - "Explicit --task=<id> targeting a completed task prints a clear message and exits without working the task"
  - "Auto/loop/epic-by-epic modes never return completed tasks as the next task"
  - "Integration test asserts each selection mode skips completed tasks"
description: "Audit every task-selection path in hench (auto, --task, --epic-by-epic, self-heal, loop) and ensure completed tasks are filtered out at the selection layer rather than relying on downstream checks. Add a single shared predicate that all selectors use so completion exclusion is enforced uniformly. Surface a clear console message when a requested task is skipped because it is already complete."
