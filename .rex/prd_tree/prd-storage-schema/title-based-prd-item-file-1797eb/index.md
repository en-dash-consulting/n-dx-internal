description: "Replace the current per-item `index.md` convention with markdown files named after the item title (lowercase, underscores instead of spaces, punctuation stripped). Each PRD item folder will contain one title-named markdown file holding the item's primary content; `index.md` is repurposed by a separate feature into a folder-level summary."
