resolutionDetail: "web-server zone dissolved into web-viewer in latest Louvain analysis (stability.reassignedFiles shows 30+ server files moved). Root cause: server files import from packages/web/src/shared/ (required by barrel-import policy), and shared/ is also imported by viewer files, creating a Louvain bridge that merges the communities. Actual server/viewer boundary is intact (boundary-check.test.ts passes). Fix: (1) documented viewer-ui-hub in CLAUDE.md fragility governance table as requested by sourcevision, (2) added web-server zone stability section explaining the dissolution pattern and recovery steps, (3) updated hints.md with zone structure guidance for future analyses, (4) corrected web-shared file count (3→5 files) in governance docs."
