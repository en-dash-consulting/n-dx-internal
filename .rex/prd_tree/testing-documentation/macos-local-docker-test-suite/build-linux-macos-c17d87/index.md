resolutionDetail: "Implemented Dockerfile.macos with Ubuntu LTS base, test-base-commands.sh smoke test script, and ndx-macos docker-compose service. All acceptance criteria met: image builds successfully, runs ndx init/analyze/status/config without errors, docker-compose.yml includes ndx-macos service, proper exit codes on success/failure."
acceptanceCriteria:
  - "Dockerfile.macos builds successfully and produces a working image"
  - "Image runs ndx init, ndx analyze, ndx status, and ndx config without errors inside the container"
  - "docker-compose.yml includes an ndx-macos service that builds from Dockerfile.macos"
  - "Container exits with code 0 on success and non-zero on any command failure"
description: "Create Dockerfile.macos (Ubuntu/Node LTS base) mirroring the structure of Dockerfile.windows — installs Node.js, pnpm, git, builds the monorepo, and runs the base-command smoke test suite (ndx init, ndx analyze, ndx status, ndx config). Add a corresponding `ndx-macos` service to docker-compose.yml alongside the existing `ndx-windows` service."
