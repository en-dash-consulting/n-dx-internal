# Audit past-week merges and produce a documentation delta report

🟠 [completed]

## Summary

Run git log for the last 7 days on main and feature branches, categorize each merged change by whether it affects the PRD structure, CLI surface, MCP tools, or architectural conventions, and produce a delta report mapping each change to the markdown files that need updating (README.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, PACKAGE_GUIDELINES.md, TESTING.md, and per-package READMEs). The recent commits include cross-PRD duplicate detection, branch-scoped PRD file targeting, multi-file PRD migration, and MCP/CLI/dashboard multi-file validation — each of these likely has doc implications.
