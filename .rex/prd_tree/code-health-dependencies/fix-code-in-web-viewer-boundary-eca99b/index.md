# Fix code in web-viewer: boundary-check.test.ts does not assert that viewer→server imports are type-only. (+2 more)

🟠 [completed]

## Summary

- boundary-check.test.ts does not assert that viewer→server imports are type-only. Since the viewer and server are separate build artifacts, any runtime import in this direction would be a build-time boundary violation. Although the current codebase has zero real server imports in viewer code, the absence of an automated assertion means a future contributor can introduce one silently — the test that enforces the web-shared addition policy is the natural place to add this guard.
- external.ts imports from shared/ leaf files (features.js, data-files.js, view-id.js) rather than through shared/index.ts, bypassing the barrel rule it enforces for every other consumer. The exemption in boundary-check.test.ts (line 326) is necessary for the test to pass but makes external.ts a misleading reference implementation. Change the three leaf-file imports in external.ts to import through ../shared/index.ts to make the reference implementation self-consistent.
- viewer/external.ts bypasses the web-shared barrel by importing from three leaf files (../shared/features.js, ../shared/data-files.js, ../shared/view-id.js) instead of consolidating to a single `from "../shared/index.js"` import. CLAUDE.md's web-shared addition policy mandates barrel-only imports for all consumers. The messaging/ exemption does not cover external.ts. boundary-check.test.ts should add an assertion that no viewer-zone file imports from web-shared leaf paths directly.
