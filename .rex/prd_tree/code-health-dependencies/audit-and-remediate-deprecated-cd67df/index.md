# Audit and remediate deprecated npm dependencies across all monorepo packages

🟠 [completed]

## Summary

Run pnpm audit and inspect each package.json for npm packages marked as deprecated, unmaintained, or superseded across packages/core, packages/rex, packages/hench, packages/sourcevision, packages/llm-client, and packages/web. Produce a prioritized remediation list distinguishing direct from transitive hits and flagging CVEs, then execute: upgrade packages with semver-compatible replacements, swap deprecated packages for their published successors, and update all call sites where replacement APIs have changed. Verify the full test suite passes after each replacement.
