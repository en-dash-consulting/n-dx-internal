description: "- packages/rex/src/cli/commands/ imports from 40+ internal submodules (core/tree, core/stats, schema/index, recommend/conflict-detection, fix/index, and 30+ others) with no boundary assertion preventing the surface from expanding. public.ts exports ~30 symbols but CLI commands bypass it entirely, creating a de-facto second internal API that is invisible to external consumers and to domain-isolation.test.js. Adding a boundary assertion — 'cli/commands/ may only import from public.ts or core/ directly' — would cap growth of this surface and make the privileged-consumer pattern explicit."
