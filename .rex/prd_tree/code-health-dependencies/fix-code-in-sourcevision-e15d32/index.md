# Fix code in sourcevision-analyzers: The sourcevision-analyzers zone is a degenerate 2-file zone containing only dead (+1 more)

🟠 [completed]

## Summary

- The sourcevision-analyzers zone is a degenerate 2-file zone containing only dead code (completion-reader.ts with zero production importers) and its own test. This zone will persist indefinitely unless a binary decision is made: delete both files if the module is abandoned, or add completion-reader to public.ts and wire it into the production pipeline if the export is intentional. Leaving the zone as-is gives sourcevision a misleading test coverage signal for a module with no callers.
- Four enrichment passes have documented completion-reader.ts as dead code (zero production importers confirmed) with no deletion decision made. The sourcevision-analyzers zone will persist indefinitely as a 2-file satellite in zone reports, creating a false coverage signal. If no decision is made to wire it into the production pipeline (add to public.ts), schedule deletion of both completion-reader.ts and completion-reader.test.ts in the next dead-code cleanup PR.
