description: "- search-overlay.ts is missing from the PANEL_FILES constant in boundary-check.test.ts (lines 257-263). The barrel-import assertion protects five other panel components but not search-overlay, meaning direct imports from components/search-overlay.ts silently pass CI. Add 'search-overlay' to the PANEL_FILES list to close the gap.\n- Replace the manually maintained PANEL_FILES array in boundary-check.test.ts with a runtime glob over the components/ directory (e.g. all files matching *-panel.ts or *-controls.ts). This closes the gap where new panel files (like search-overlay.ts) are added without updating the constant, and makes the barrel-import enforcement self-maintaining."
