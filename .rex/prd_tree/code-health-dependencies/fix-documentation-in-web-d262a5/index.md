# Fix documentation in web-helpers: Zone name 'web-helpers' is misleading for a single-component zone — it invites s (+1 more)

🟠 [completed]

## Summary

- Zone name 'web-helpers' is misleading for a single-component zone — it invites scope creep by suggesting a general utility bucket rather than a bounded component zone, and may attract future additions that bypass the two-consumer rule check.
- Add a 'confirmed zone-level cycles' section to CLAUDE.md's architectural governance table, separate from the metric-based dual-fragility table. The only true cycle in the monorepo is more dangerous than all metric-triggered zones yet is invisible to threshold-based governance because web-helpers has cohesion 1 and coupling 0.
