resolutionDetail: "Added `autonomous` flag to SharedLoopOptions/FinalizeRunOptions, computed as `auto || loop || epicByEpic` in run.ts, and propagated it through runOne → cliLoop/agentLoop → finalizeRun → performCommitPromptIfNeeded. The approval prompt is now bypassed when either `yes` or `autonomous` is set (same mechanism that already gates task autoselect). Exported performCommitPromptIfNeeded for direct unit testing; new integration test packages/hench/tests/integration/commit-prompt.test.ts covers three cases: autonomous bypass (commits using the proposed message, no prompt), interactive path (readline is invoked and user decision respected), and --yes bypass. All 2483 hench tests pass; typecheck clean across the monorepo. Two pre-existing zone-cohesion e2e failures (tick zone cohesion 0.44 < 0.5; stale `sync` entry in COHESION_EXCEPTIONS) are unrelated to this change — verified against git stash. No commit-config toggle was introduced; reused existing auto/loop flag state per AC #4."
acceptanceCriteria:
  - "ndx work --auto completes commits without prompting for commit message approval"
  - "ndx work --loop completes commits without prompting for commit message approval"
  - "ndx work (no auto/loop flags) still prompts for commit message approval as before"
  - "The bypass is driven by the same flag state that governs other autonomous behaviors, not a separate toggle"
  - "Unit or integration test covers both the bypass and the interactive path"
description: "The hench agent's commit workflow currently prompts the user to approve generated commit messages before finalizing a commit. In autonomous modes (--auto, --loop), there is no interactive user to respond, causing runs to hang or time out. Detect these flags at the point the commit-approval check is invoked and skip the prompt, falling back to the generated commit message without confirmation. Preserve the existing interactive behavior for normal (non-autonomous) runs."
