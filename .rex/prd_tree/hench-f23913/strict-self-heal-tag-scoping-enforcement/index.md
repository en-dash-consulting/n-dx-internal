description: "The self-heal loop is documented to tag items it creates and to only operate on tagged items, but recent observation suggests the scope filter is not being enforced strictly enough — self-heal runs are picking up untagged tasks. Lock down the contract so self-heal sessions exclusively tag every created item with the 'self-heal-items' marker and the task selector refuses to execute any item missing that tag. This hardens the behavior previously delivered under feature ae28134a (selection filter) and feature 2e184cee (tag attribution)."

# Strict Self-Heal Tag Scoping Enforcement

 [pending]

## Summary

The self-heal loop is documented to tag items it creates and to only operate on tagged items, but recent observation suggests the scope filter is not being enforced strictly enough — self-heal runs are picking up untagged tasks. Lock down the contract so self-heal sessions exclusively tag every created item with the 'self-heal-items' marker and the task selector refuses to execute any item missing that tag. This hardens the behavior previously delivered under feature ae28134a (selection filter) and feature 2e184cee (tag attribution).
