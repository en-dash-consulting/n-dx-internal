acceptanceCriteria:
  - "Hench agent prompt assembly includes the no-plan-mode skill for autonomous and acceptEdits-mode runs"
  - "Regression test fails if the skill is removed from the assembled skill list for autonomous runs"
  - "Documentation in CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md references the skill where plan-mode behavior is discussed"
  - "Manual smoke run of `ndx work --auto` confirms the agent does not emit ExitPlanMode for execution tasks"
description: "Ensure the new skill is injected into the prompt/skill set used by hench-driven Claude agent runs (and any other ndx execution paths that spawn agents), and add a regression test asserting that the skill appears in the assembled prompt context for autonomous runs. This closes the loop so the rule is actually applied at runtime, not just authored."
