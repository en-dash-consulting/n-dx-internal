  - "No front-matter field (id, title, status, priority, etc.) is duplicated between the named file and any co-located index.md"
description: "The serializer currently writes an index.md for every directory it creates, even when the folder holds only one named file. The rule must be: emit an index.md only when the folder contains two or more distinct named child files (excluding index.md itself). When exactly one named file exists, write only that named file — no index.md. This prevents the duplicate front-matter situation where the same item's metadata appears in both files."

__parentDescription: "The single-child compaction landed in the prior cycle but did not prevent index.md files from being created alongside a single named file. This feature enforces the invariant at the serializer level: an index.md must only be written when a folder contains two or more unique named child files. It also eliminates the duplicate front-matter that currently appears between a named file and its co-located index.md."

# Fix folder-tree serializer to suppress index.md when fewer than two named child files exist

🔴 [completed]

## Summary

The serializer currently writes an index.md for every directory it creates, even when the folder holds only one named file. The rule must be: emit an index.md only when the folder contains two or more distinct named child files (excluding index.md itself). When exactly one named file exists, write only that named file — no index.md. This prevents the duplicate front-matter situation where the same item's metadata appears in both files.
