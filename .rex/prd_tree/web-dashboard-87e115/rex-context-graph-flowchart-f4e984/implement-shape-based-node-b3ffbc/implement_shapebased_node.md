acceptanceCriteria:
  - "Nodes with index.md plus additional non-index.md siblings render as diamonds"
  - "Nodes with only non-index.md files and no subdirectory children render as squares"
  - "Nodes whose children are exclusively subdirectories render as trapezoids"
  - "Leaf nodes with no children of any kind render as triangles"
  - "Nodes that match none of the above rules render as circles"
  - "A legend is visible in the graph UI labeling each shape with its structural meaning"
  - "Shape classification logic is unit-tested with folder-tree fixtures covering all five shape categories"
description: "Classify each graph node by inspecting its position in the `.rex/prd_tree/` structure and assign a shape according to these rules: diamond — parent node that contains both an index.md and at least one other non-index.md file; square — parent node with only non-index.md files and no subdirectory children; trapezoid — parent node whose children are exclusively subdirectories (no direct files); triangle — leaf task node with no children of any kind; circle — default for nodes that don't match any rule above. Update the SVG/graph rendering layer to draw each node in its assigned shape and add a shape legend to the graph UI."
