acceptanceCriteria:
  - "Clicking any node in the context graph opens the Rex task detail panel with that item's data"
  - "The panel displays the same fields shown for the same item in the Rex tasks view"
  - "Clicking the active node a second time, or pressing Escape, dismisses the panel"
  - "Keyboard navigation reaches nodes (Tab) and can open/close the panel (Enter / Escape)"
  - "No new detail panel component is introduced — the existing tasks-view panel is reused"
  - "Opening the detail panel does not alter graph zoom, pan, or node positions"
description: "Make each node in the Rex context graph clickable. On click, open the existing Rex task detail panel (already implemented in the tasks view) displaying the selected item's full information — title, description, status, acceptance criteria, tags, LoE, and branch/commit attribution. The panel must be the same component used in the tasks view, not a new implementation. Clicking the same node again or pressing Escape should close the panel."
