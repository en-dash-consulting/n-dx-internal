status: "pending"
source: "smart-add"
acceptanceCriteria: []
description: "The 'project setup is stale' notice is currently emitted in CLI contexts where it shouldn't appear, creating noise for users with fully initialized projects. Replace the trigger heuristic with a direct filesystem check for the three tool directories (.sourcevision, .rex, .hench) and only surface the message when one or more is missing."
