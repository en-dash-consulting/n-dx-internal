Refresh the Claude model catalog shown in `ndx init` and align the runtime default. Adds **Claude Fable 5** (`claude-fable-5`) and **Claude Sonnet 5** (`claude-sonnet-5`) to the selector, and promotes Sonnet 5 to the recommended default (replacing the previous-generation Sonnet 4.6 as the pre-selected model and as `DEFAULT_CLAUDE_MODEL` / `NEWEST_MODELS.claude`). Sonnet 5's 1M context window and pricing are registered for budget preflight. `claude-sonnet-4-6` remains a valid, accepted model id (kept in the context/cost maps and added to the init legacy-alias list) so existing configs and `--claude-model=claude-sonnet-4-6` keep working without warnings. Codex and Gemini catalogs are unchanged.
